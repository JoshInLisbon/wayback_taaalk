Phil has clearly put in a ton of mental game work over the years and to someone like myself (relatively new to the industry/game), it's inspiring and something to push towards in the future!</div></div>

There are a lot of elite commentators that through use of a charismatic delivery technique or deflection can avoid answering complex questions (and that's completely fine, they're there to entertain), but that's just not what I want to be labelled as.Â </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I think that's what this challenge has inspired me to do differently/for the first time, really try and step up my commentary game. I've enrolled in a couple of courses, I'm reading a ton of books at the moment and highlighting words that I don't understand etc to prepare myself for future gigs.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I don't want people to leave a stream and ask themselves "wow, does this kid really play poker for a living?". I want people to tune in and leave with the impression that they've learnt something new thanks to my competent way of explaining ideas and theories. I'm also aware that even if I do improve on those things, there are still going to be people that don't enjoy my commentary. But if there's one thing Phil has taught me is - you've just got to learn how to silence out all the background noise and focus on the task at hand.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to sell myself short here, I understand my value as a commentator. I gel well with different personality types in the booth, I stay active with the viewers and ask a bunch of questions to make them feel a part of each stream. But, this challenge has inspired me to try and expand beyond that. There are 100's of people that can do what I do, but there's only one Nick Schulman!Â </div></div>

A bit vague I know but the here are the two main concepts that come to mind:</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">- The elasticity of a players range</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">- Range merging</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">The latter was certainly the most difficult in my opinion. Following on from the VeniVidi match, we saw a lot river range merging from both Phil and ActionFreak that was getting attacked at what felt like almost 100% frequency.Â </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">It was extremely difficult for me to on the fly, firstly pick a hand that say Phil wanted to include in his merged range and then have to almost immediately pick a hand he wanted to bluff catch with vs a raise.Â </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">That's another part of the intricate game tree that I don't think many viewers truly appreciated. To the naked eye, we were just watching some nosebleed stakes being played by Phil Galfond and "some online crusher".Â </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">The fact that it was so difficult in the commentary booth goes to show just how advanced Phil and ActionFreak are. It's truly remarkable how they adapted on the fly and implemented and experimented with new strategies constantly.Â </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">You could argue that their job is easier. What I mean by that is it would have been considerably easier for us in the booth by just knowing 4 of the hole cards, to then help with a certain spots including blockers, range merging etc. The counter argument to that is they were playing for hundreds of thousands of euros whilst trying to play an extremely tough opponent whilst we were just commentating.Â </div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">He does indeed, and deservedly so!Â </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So to break it down for readers that aren't familiar with the term "range merging" - range merging in poker is where we bet with medium-strength hands on the river on board textures where we should only be betting with the nuts or bluffing, thus allowing our medium strength hands to get called by worse "bluff catchers" or potentially get better hands to fold.Â </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">What seemed to be happening a lot during both matches (again to reiterate, I really struggled with this myself) is that where Veni/Freak/Phil seemed to be merge betting in river spots, typically betting a 1/3 sizing, an aggressive counter strategy was being implemented.Â </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I'm not sure whether it was just a case of "well this sizing is clearly a merge sizing and I have a decent blocker, let's smash the pot button because our opponent is capped with medium strength hands" but in the commentary booth, that's what it looked like!Â </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">We did see some adjustments being made from all 3 players. We saw Phil adapt really well against Veni around 10k hands into the match and there's one hand that sticks out vs ActionFreak where Phil actually induced on the river by using a "mergey sizing" with a hand he should have been using a polarized sizing at a very high frequency and ultimately got Freak to put his money in the middle with a bluff catcher.Â </div></div>

      <p><strong>So why did Taaalk get built?</strong></p>
      <p>The world is filled with people who know lots of cool stuff and weird things. When it comes to interviews, traditionally it's been the case that a journalist has to take an interest in what you do before you get one. That doesn't happen too often, so it's probablyÂ the case that the world is under-interviewed. TaaalkÂ is here to change that. INTERVIEWS FOR EVERYONE.</p>
      <p>But the word "interview" doesn't really capture what TaaalkÂ is about. It's a bit too formal, and implies there is one person with all the knowledge (the interviewee) and another person getting it from them (the journalist/interviewer). TaaalkÂ can be used more flexiblyÂ than that. Four people (a TaaalkÂ can have any number of people) who know a lot about a subject can have an extremely nerdy and detailed Taaalk about it. Three people who don't know too much about anything can blab away to each other, just because they enjoy blabbing. And you don't even need to invite anyone to your Taaalk, if you want to write a poem every day, or share a continuousÂ stream of thoughts about a subject of your choice, you can use Taaalk as a place to do that; monologues are a-ok.</p>
      <p>And TaaalkÂ is built for you to be even more creative than that. You can invite yourself to your own Taaalk, change the second-you's details and have an imaginary conversation. You can invite yourself to a Taaalk any number of times, and write a whole play made up of the dialogue of imaginary characters.Â </p>
      <p><strong>If you don't have anyone to TaaalkÂ with today</strong>, you can leave your details on the <a href="/start-conversation">Start a Conversation</a> page. This means someone looking to TaaalkÂ can introduce themselves to you. And you can introduce yourself to someone else who has left their details.</p>
      <p>More seriously, <strong>we have all grown up in a digital world thatÂ is a bit awkward</strong>. In the real world you don't walk around shouting out random facts and opinions, instead you talk to people. And in the real world while you're talking, hundreds of random people don't jump into your conversation. The best chats have a healthy level of intimacy. TaaalkÂ tries to recreate these real world properties online. Firstly, it is all about talking (taaalking). Back and forths. This makes things feel a bit more natural than shouting out snip-its of thoughts and ideas. There's also no character limit and you can save drafts before you reply, so it's a place for deep conversations. You might find that you enjoy TaaalkingÂ even if you have normally found yourself to be a bit too shy to fully enjoy other platforms. Secondly, though anyone can read a Taaalk, only the people the "TaaalkÂ Owner" (the person who started the Taaalk) chooses can join in the conversation. This keeps things intimate.</p>
      <p><strong>What you say matters (and might embarrass you).</strong> Because of this TaaalkÂ comes with features to make you feel safe sharing your thoughts. Firstly, even if you are not the TaaalkÂ Owner, you can leave a Taaalk and delete all your messages at the same time. The Taaalk will still exist, but what you've written will not. If you are a TaaalkÂ Owner you can delete your Taaalk at any time. You can delete your account, deleting all messages you've written on the Taaalk platform and all the Taaalks you've started at the same time. It's possible to edit or delete an individual message after you have written it. And because it's possible to edit a message after someone has responded to it, we flag up when a message has been edited, so if you are the responder, you don't have to worry about someone changing the question after you've written a response to it. We hope these measures make you feel safe to share yourself on Taaalk, and if you have any more ideas, please come to the <a href="/t/taaalk-feedback">TaaalkÂ feedback conversation</a> to discuss them.</p>
