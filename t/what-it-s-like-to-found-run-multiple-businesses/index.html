  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Actually my first venture was a secondary school hustle! Around 1987/1988 everyone was buying Commodore Amiga and Atari ST computers. They were way more powerful than the old 8-bit computers that we had grown up with, but they required 3.5 inch floppy disks as opposed to cassettes.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">We used to all buy loads of games for these machines, and swap them with each other at school. After a while people realised that they could buy blank floppy disks and use a tool called XCopy to copy the game onto a blank disk before giving it back. Back then blank floppy disks were a valuable currency at school. One day I went to a computer fair in London with my dad and brother and found vendors that were selling big boxes of blank floppy disks *way* cheaper than what we had been paying at our local computer shop. My brother and I borrowed some money off my dad and bought a couple of boxes (I think maybe it was 50 disks per box). I took one box to school and my brother took the other. We sold both boxes in something like 2 days.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">After restocking a few weeks later I had a network of kids in other years who would act as resellers for me. It was a good laugh at that point. I'd sell other kids a box at a reduced profit and they would sell them through to their peer group.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I seem to remember we were making 100% margin or near that figure; They were Â£1 per disk at school. We started getting good relationships with the disk suppliers at these fairs and began ordering them directly. I can't think how many disks we sold; more than a thousand over the period that we were selling them. Before long however the disks became commoditised. There were other kids that started doing what we were doing so we had to start competing with them, and then the local shops started selling them more cheaply, but we had a good run!</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">It's funny writing all that and thinking about it now as it taught me a lot of important lessons. All the basics are there; seeing the opportunity, borrowing money for cashflow, arbitraging the price of the product between two markets and then over time seeing the price gap close along with the opportunity, employing a sales force. Although I didn't know it at the time, it was a pretty good microcosm to learn from.</div></div>

I think a little bit that if you define yourself as an entrepreneur then you be definition aren't one.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">There's this idea of the 'wannapreneur'; a derogatory label for people who go through the motions of entrepreneurialism but don't actually produce anything. They go to the conferences, the event drinks and all that side of things, and are generally really good at networking, but there is no substance behind what they do. They are bullshitters and you can spot them a mile away. ! I do subscribe to that idea a little bit which is probably not constructive, but whatever, it's a free country.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Paul Graham talks about this in his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030853/http://genius.com/Paul-graham-lecture-3-counterintuitive-parts-of-startups-and-how-to-have-ideas-annotated">Stanford Lecture</a> - people who are "playing house":</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble"><em>another characteristic mistake of young founders starting startups is to go through the motions of starting a startup. They come up with some plausible sounding idea, they raise funding to get a nice valuation, then the next step is they rent a nice office in SoMa and hire a bunch of their friends, until they gradually realize how completely fucked they are because while imitating all the outward forms of starting a startup, they have neglected the one thing that is actually essential, which is to make something people want.</em></div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I was at University between '94 and '98. Mosaic, the first "proper" web browser was released in 1993, so I was perfectly timed with regards to the birth of the Internet and the web. The first time we saw Mosaic, and realised there were websites outside of our University one, and that they were all linked; we all just sat the in stunned silence. It seemed obvious at that point how powerful the idea of the web and the Internet would be. I remember really clearly in 1995 sitting in my student house with my friends and arguing about whether we should all quit our degrees and start a web design firm. We decided not to, and it's one of the only decisions I have taken that I have come to later regret.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So maybe I'm not entrepreneurial!</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Yeah I think that's an interesting point to consider. When I started Solid State Group as a web agency, "startups" weren't a thing. This was 2002, so there was no Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Basecamp, Xero or pretty much any sort of SaaS product. The dot com bubble had burst and the internet industry as a whole was pretty much destroyed. So many agencies had gone to the wall, and most of the big startups had flamed out dramatically. It was sort of a crazy time to be starting a web development agency.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">In 2002 I got made redundant a second time within a year. I thought about getting another job as a software engineer somewhere but then decided against it; starting my own company would be just as secure an option! So I sat in my bedroom for about 5 months straight and wrote a Content Management System that turned out (at the time) to be pretty good. I had a business partner who would now be described as a Product Manager and between us we carved out this business.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I had just bought a flat when I got laid off the second time, so making money was a crystal clear target. That sharpens the mind a lot. Everything we did was oriented around getting clients and sending them invoices; preferably large invoices. The notion of raising money for a new venture at that time was absurd; there was just no way anyone was going to give money to us. It would have been a complete waste of time even trying, so we had to bootstrap. I had 3 months of runway from my severance package and that was it.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Fast forward to London in 2015 and it's pretty crazy just how much as changed; not only the industry but also the operating environment for new companies. I get that some companies need to be heavily capitalised to grow rapidly, but some of the bullshit you see is pretty breathtaking. When you see people having parties to celebrate closing their A round! Celebrating! They should be devastated!</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Everyone argues about bootstrapping vs raising rounds, but really it boils down to whether you are making money or not. All the successful ventures I have gone into were profitable within the first year; all of them. You don't have to know anything technical; you just need to orient your business around making fucking money. That's it.</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Getting our first clients was REALLY hard. We did that classic thing of building a product and then expecting people to turn up at our day with a chequebook, but that didn't happen. We got a couple of small projects from friends that we didn't make any money on, but were invaluable as case studies for our website. When you start an agency it's all about demonstrating credibility as quickly as possible.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I don't quite remember how we got our first real big lead; I think it might have been through organic search. Google in 2002 was a very different beast, and both organic search and paid search were not the food fight they are today. It was either paid or organic search. The lead was a really good one though - 4 content managed websites for Essex council. We had a couple of weeks to prepare for the pitch.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">One of the best pieces of advice I was given was about how you can use your small size in comparison to your competitors to your own advantage. Even though this was a relatively small contract for most people, it would have been a massive deal for us to win it. We decided to take one of the client's current websites and basically implement the entire thing on our CMS, to demonstrate who easy it would be for them to manage the site themselves. This was a pretty big undertaking, and there's no way we would do something like this now, but as I said, you use your small size in any way you can.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So I spent a few days doing this implementation. When it got to the pitch we just totally nailed it; the client was blown away that we had taken the trouble of doing all this work to show our system, and we got the news that we had won the contract on the way home! That was a massive deal and one of the best memories I have of running my own business.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">One really important point to make is how these moments, right at the start of the company, are the ones that burn into your memory as the highlights. I used to think that the best moments would be when you are sat in your ivory tower, sending out massive invoices and talking to your big team, but that's bollocks. It's all about sitting in your pyjamas at 3AM hacking on some code because you can't sleep through excitement.</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">After about a year in business we scored a really big project; the website build and CMS for that year's BRIT awards. That was a really big deal for us; it was the first really mass-market site we had worked on and got us really good exposure. It also meant a metric shit-load of traffic for about 3 days straight, which had me really really nervous. It was a great client (thanks John, Dan and Francis!) and a great challenge that we totally nailed. We got tickets to the show and after party. We went and got stuck into the free booze but I was still completely terrified that the site would melt under the load of millions of concurrent users, but thankfully it did the job.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Anyway, after that I think it did become easier to get work, yes. There's a good triangulation of better case studies, more people that you are working with who can then recommend your work and then the perfect situation of when a client changes job and takes you with them. It all does start to build. Obviously your work has to be over a certain threshold of "good" but really most people just want a safe pair of hands that isn't going to wobble at the wrong moment.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">It's one of those things that you can only indirectly affect. If you try too hard at winning new business you wont get anywhere, but if you put your irons in the fire and just keep things humming eventually it comes to you. I think the mistake a lot of people make is to try and do all this direct, immediate stuff, and it's just really really hard to win work that way. You have to play the long game, and start playing it as early as possible.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">All that changed in 2008/2009. The 2 years between 2009 and 2011 were absolutely fucking horrible and an experience I never wish to repeat. I'm still absolutely furious that no one has been held to account with regards to what happened in the financial markets, and have spent the last 4 years making sure that I am insulated from all that bullshit as much as possible. It's hard to know what would have happened to the business if the meltdown had not occurred. We basically trod water for 3 years and only recently started growing again.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I don't code at 3am any more, no. That stuff is a one-time-only deal. It's bad for you! I do still hack at code to keep my eye in and still really enjoy it, but I've been overtaken by all these kids who can code in 5 different languages and have more stickers on their Macs than I do.</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">The Hoxton Mix was a business we completely stumbled upon. Way back in 2004 we were looking for an office for our 4 person company. We realised we were growing and so we found a nice premises in Shoreditch that could fit about 14 people in to. Our first office was just Matt and myself, and we shared with another company. So we just did exactly the same thing. This was before gumtree or Twitter (!) so we went and stuck a notice up in Franco's, which at the time was THE place to get a lunch in Shoreditch.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">We got the space filled pretty easily, and it actually helped cover a lot of our rent. One of the first companies that moved in was 3 guys called Square Circle; a design and UX agency. We got on with them really well, and before long were pitching on a huge project, that we landed. That turned out to be well into six figures worth of work, and at that moment we realised the value of co-working, especially in Shoreditch which has an insane density of companies all doing similar things.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">When we moved out of the smaller office, we actually went into business with Square Circle, and they are now joint owners of the Hoxton Mix. From there we opened 2 other premises and now have over 150 desks being rented out. It's great seeing small companies working together, and we have really active mailing list where people ask for help, advice or even offer pitches to people.</div></div>

It's almost as if doing what I'm doing is maybe perceived as less worthy. The extreme of that obviously is Rocket Internet in Germany who "clone" US businesses.

So I'll look at the market overall, whether it is growing and at what rate (superb piece of advice I was given: only sell into a growing market!). Then do things like using the Google Adwords Keyword Tool to see what sort of traffic a key term for a business would receive.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I guess I am more analytical now, but I am mainly doing this to decide what not to work on, as opposed to what to work on. For example the other day an opportunity came up which initially sounded really great, but after looking at the number of people searching Google for the particular relevant term, we decided not to go ahead with any sort of further work on it, because the scale was not there. I'm not talking about the billion dollar businesses that big VCs are after, but just something that would get a relatively good ROI.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Also I think this is particularly relevant:</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">

</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">What I mean by this is that the more money there is on the table, the harder it is to achieve success. Obviously there's luck, timing etc, but on the whole I think this graph is representative of real life. So we aren't really aiming at billion dollar businesses. There's a lot of low hanging fruit that is not going to return that sort of money but is still going to give good returns, and of course you are still in control of your own destiny and not working for the man.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">With one of the companies I work with we joke about different levels of money. You go up in scale. Car money, house money, yacht money, island money. If you are always working on startups that are aiming at yacht or island money, you're going to have a hard time! We aim more at house money businesses. I think soon we will have enough recurring revenue coming in that we can try riskier projects that have a higher return, but I think generally it's a good idea to start at car money and work your way up.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">You get kicked in the balls less that way.</div></div>

Everything from the UX to the App store side of things to the support is just mega impressive. Especially considering that eCommerce can be really really complex. They have really helped the GetVape guys launch and iterate their offering quickly, which has been invaluable.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I think Slack are in an interesting position too. What's interesting to me about Slack is how they demonstrated the power of UX. There were plenty of group chat apps around before Slack (Campfire, Hipchat, IRC, Lync and a load of enterprise ones) so ostensibly you would think that Slack would not be able to grow orders of magnitude more quickly than those other products but they have. I think the reason that they have is because they are just completely nailing the UX side of things. There are so many tiny little details in Slack, and I keep finding them, months and months after using the product heavily, day after day. I find that really impressive.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Vice are another interesting company. Funnily enough we used to share an office building with them on Leonard Street back in the day where rents in Shoreditch were still in their teens. Back then they were just this utter cliche. It just looked like Nathan Barley. They were mainly a high end fashion print magazine back then. If you look at the quality of writing, reporting and video coming out of their London office now I am always taken aback. Plus they know how to take the piss out of themselves now. Back then they were way too moody!</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">In terms of people, I'm loving the words coming out of the mouth and hands of Chris Dixon (@cdixon) and Ben Evans (@benedictevans) from a16z as well as Rob Fitzpatrick (@robfitz) on the startup side and Matt Taibbi (@mtaibbi) on the speaking truth to power thing.</div></div>

Sure, you have a responsibility to the investors, and you need to provide regular investor updates etc etc, but by their nature this whole lead investor aspect just disappears.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Admittedly the amounts that you can raise through crowdfunding is lower than what you would raise in a typical series A, but I think for seed rounds they are really attractive, for the reasons given above. I guess it can act as a double edged sword, as you don't have investors to go to for advice, but I guess it depends on what is important to you when you are raising money.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">There are also interesting aspects from the investor side too. Someone might invest only Â£500 to a company, but they then get the chance to âsee insideâ that business. To a lot of people, me for example, the information that comes from those investor reports is potentially very valuable. How are Facebook display ads performing? What are they paying per app-install? What about video retargeting? All these soft aspects of the business (especially marketing) are then available to see.</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I'm kind of shit at online marketing and don't pretend to be an expert! One thing I have discovered, however, is that the demographic has an enormous influence on which marketing channels you should focus on. For example, one of our investments is www.getvape.co.uk . They have found huge traction through Facebook, whereas Twitter has been pretty much worthless for them. Whatever it is, vapers are just not that into Twitter. On the flip side, we are building a fantasy football platform ourselves - www.dugoutfc.com - and for football fans, Twitter is MASSIVE. There are dozens of fan accounts that have over 100k followers.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">One of the things we consider now is to try and have no preconceptions about channels and demographics, and basically just spray out everywhere initially, but then focus down on one or two channels very quickly. That seems to be the best way of finding where you are going to get best ROI and then seeing how big that channel can be.</div></div>

You could have invented Facebook in 1997, but at the time the notion of sharing personal aspects of our lives on line was just totally alien.

      <p><strong>So why did Taaalk get built?</strong></p>
      <p>The world is filled with people who know lots of cool stuff and weird things. When it comes to interviews, traditionally it's been the case that a journalist has to take an interest in what you do before you get one. That doesn't happen too often, so it's probablyÂ the case that the world is under-interviewed. TaaalkÂ is here to change that. INTERVIEWS FOR EVERYONE.</p>
      <p>But the word "interview" doesn't really capture what TaaalkÂ is about. It's a bit too formal, and implies there is one person with all the knowledge (the interviewee) and another person getting it from them (the journalist/interviewer). TaaalkÂ can be used more flexiblyÂ than that. Four people (a TaaalkÂ can have any number of people) who know a lot about a subject can have an extremely nerdy and detailed Taaalk about it. Three people who don't know too much about anything can blab away to each other, just because they enjoy blabbing. And you don't even need to invite anyone to your Taaalk, if you want to write a poem every day, or share a continuousÂ stream of thoughts about a subject of your choice, you can use Taaalk as a place to do that; monologues are a-ok.</p>
      <p>And TaaalkÂ is built for you to be even more creative than that. You can invite yourself to your own Taaalk, change the second-you's details and have an imaginary conversation. You can invite yourself to a Taaalk any number of times, and write a whole play made up of the dialogue of imaginary characters.Â </p>
      <p><strong>If you don't have anyone to TaaalkÂ with today</strong>, you can leave your details on the <a href="/start-conversation">Start a Conversation</a> page. This means someone looking to TaaalkÂ can introduce themselves to you. And you can introduce yourself to someone else who has left their details.</p>
      <p>More seriously, <strong>we have all grown up in a digital world thatÂ is a bit awkward</strong>. In the real world you don't walk around shouting out random facts and opinions, instead you talk to people. And in the real world while you're talking, hundreds of random people don't jump into your conversation. The best chats have a healthy level of intimacy. TaaalkÂ tries to recreate these real world properties online. Firstly, it is all about talking (taaalking). Back and forths. This makes things feel a bit more natural than shouting out snip-its of thoughts and ideas. There's also no character limit and you can save drafts before you reply, so it's a place for deep conversations. You might find that you enjoy TaaalkingÂ even if you have normally found yourself to be a bit too shy to fully enjoy other platforms. Secondly, though anyone can read a Taaalk, only the people the "TaaalkÂ Owner" (the person who started the Taaalk) chooses can join in the conversation. This keeps things intimate.</p>
      <p><strong>What you say matters (and might embarrass you).</strong> Because of this TaaalkÂ comes with features to make you feel safe sharing your thoughts. Firstly, even if you are not the TaaalkÂ Owner, you can leave a Taaalk and delete all your messages at the same time. The Taaalk will still exist, but what you've written will not. If you are a TaaalkÂ Owner you can delete your Taaalk at any time. You can delete your account, deleting all messages you've written on the Taaalk platform and all the Taaalks you've started at the same time. It's possible to edit or delete an individual message after you have written it. And because it's possible to edit a message after someone has responded to it, we flag up when a message has been edited, so if you are the responder, you don't have to worry about someone changing the question after you've written a response to it. We hope these measures make you feel safe to share yourself on Taaalk, and if you have any more ideas, please come to the <a href="/t/taaalk-feedback">TaaalkÂ feedback conversation</a> to discuss them.</p>
