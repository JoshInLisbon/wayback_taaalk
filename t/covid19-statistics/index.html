Having a bit more time than I would normally during lockdown I began creating these charts and found people were also finding them useful on Reddit so have continued. The useful feedback I've got has also helped to form them, they were pretty basic at the start! I've also seen it as a bit of a visual challenge to get as much information into one chart so it has lots of detail but is also easy to read.</div></div>

I think there is such a rush to get the latest breaking information on how many deaths have happened today there has been little interest in reporting the accurate picture which you need time to establish. The chart on Sunday showed that the rolling average of deaths in hospital fell below 100 on the 30th May, this is a major milestone however as we are only able to establish this with some certainly 8 days out it doesn't get reported. Just a few days ago we were reporting that deaths were 300+, which given the trends in the chart is very unlikely.</div></div>

There has been a lot of debate around this especially when the comparison graphs on the government daily briefings were dropped as we were leading. I do believe it is the case that these had been used as at first it showed us lower than other countries, as soon as we started to take the lead they were dropped. Really they shouldn't had been there from the start. Just looking at the numbers in Spain they dropped last week to 0 which got a lot of coverage, whereas what had happened is Spain had changed their method of reporting. It will take time to carefully, hopefully independently, analyse excess death figures from other countries until we have a clear picture of what has happened globally. </div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So it's quite surprising that when you look at the daily number of lab confirmed cases in England how closely it follows the deaths by actual day chart. The peak is only one day off the deaths chart for example and the sharp increase followed by exponential decay in the rolling average are remarkably similar. Personally I would have thought due to the lack of testing earlier in the pandemic numbers would be under recorded and cases while going down over time from the peak wouldn't fall in the same way. As testing capacity increased you'd expect to be picking up more cases even though overall number in the country would be falling. I must admit this isn't something I can explain.</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Regarding a second wave, this is something which has been mooted due to what has happened in previous pandemics and certainly in some states of America at the moment there doesn't seem to be a slowing that has been experienced in many European countries and a second wave is feared.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">It is important to highlight I'm no epidemiologist however I do keep a keen watch on what's happening with the coronavirus so this is purely my opinion.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Clearly opening things up again you would expect transmission to rise, and therefore a second wave. There are a number of factors which are in play here however. The warmer temperatures in Summer do help slow this virus, people even though things are opening up are being more careful and a lot of social distancing measures are now in place, a proportion of people now have antibodies to the virus (supposed to be 20%+) in London which removes them from spreading, and there are now a number of different strains of coronavirus in transmission. All viruses survive by reproducing and often there is a slight mistake in the genetic code, this is what leads to mutations. </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Over time as a virus spreads it will be the mutations which are able to spread the most which are the most successful and this tends to favour the weaker strains. Any stronger mutations which remove the host from society or even worse kill the host are not going to have the same ability to spread. A mutation of coronavirus where most people are asymptomatic will have the most success of spreading. </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">It may be optimistic but I am hopeful lockdown has helped protect us from the stronger strains which were around in the early part of the year and now coming out of lockdown, with all the additional factors considered, it will be weaker strains which help keep deaths from the virus low and ultimately kill off the virus with or without a vaccine.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Again I will reiterate this is purely my opinion based of numerous academic sources online and is not the expert view of an epidemiologist which you really need here, so take with a pinch of salt.</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I think in terms of the most timely measures to identify a second peak will first be hospital admissions followed by deaths. If the virus weakens and there is a rise in asymptomatic cases it may well be the case that the amount testing positive to the virus do increase even though this won't register on hospital admissions or deaths - however again it will depend how testing is carried out. At the moment you can get a test if you have symptoms, if you don't then these tests aren't being carried out. I would hope with increased testing capacity there can be testing on a large scale of specific areas and settings allowing us get a more accurate picture of what's going on.</div></div>

I understand that we have been ambitious but I think we should think in factors more than that - 10 times as ambitious at least. I want to live in a world where COVID testing trucks are driving down every street on a recurring basis, and getting people out of their homes one by one to perform tests.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">The news today is all about Conservative back benchers asking for the 2m rule to be changed to a 1m rule, but ultimately the public confidence has to be there to open up the country in any meaningful way. I don't think it is right now (maybe a decent period without a rise in cases will make that happen). A testing strategy which was aggressive and present would change that.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I'd say that this microcosm of the unambitious (and therefore more affordable) approach to testing is a systematic problem with the government's approach. We do not go extreme enough fast enough, and paradoxically with this virus that is exactly the approach that is needed to squash it. Cost saving (whether that be allowing a few more weeks of economic activity before lock down, or not going to the moon with tests) ends up costing more.</div></div>

      <p><strong>So why did Taaalk get built?</strong></p>
      <p>The world is filled with people who know lots of cool stuff and weird things. When it comes to interviews, traditionally it's been the case that a journalist has to take an interest in what you do before you get one. That doesn't happen too often, so it's probably the case that the world is under-interviewed. Taaalk is here to change that. INTERVIEWS FOR EVERYONE.</p>
      <p>But the word "interview" doesn't really capture what Taaalk is about. It's a bit too formal, and implies there is one person with all the knowledge (the interviewee) and another person getting it from them (the journalist/interviewer). Taaalk can be used more flexibly than that. Four people (a Taaalk can have any number of people) who know a lot about a subject can have an extremely nerdy and detailed Taaalk about it. Three people who don't know too much about anything can blab away to each other, just because they enjoy blabbing. And you don't even need to invite anyone to your Taaalk, if you want to write a poem every day, or share a continuous stream of thoughts about a subject of your choice, you can use Taaalk as a place to do that; monologues are a-ok.</p>
      <p>And Taaalk is built for you to be even more creative than that. You can invite yourself to your own Taaalk, change the second-you's details and have an imaginary conversation. You can invite yourself to a Taaalk any number of times, and write a whole play made up of the dialogue of imaginary characters. </p>
      <p><strong>If you don't have anyone to Taaalk with today</strong>, you can leave your details on the <a href="/start-conversation">Start a Conversation</a> page. This means someone looking to Taaalk can introduce themselves to you. And you can introduce yourself to someone else who has left their details.</p>
      <p>More seriously, <strong>we have all grown up in a digital world that is a bit awkward</strong>. In the real world you don't walk around shouting out random facts and opinions, instead you talk to people. And in the real world while you're talking, hundreds of random people don't jump into your conversation. The best chats have a healthy level of intimacy. Taaalk tries to recreate these real world properties online. Firstly, it is all about talking (taaalking). Back and forths. This makes things feel a bit more natural than shouting out snip-its of thoughts and ideas. There's also no character limit and you can save drafts before you reply, so it's a place for deep conversations. You might find that you enjoy Taaalking even if you have normally found yourself to be a bit too shy to fully enjoy other platforms. Secondly, though anyone can read a Taaalk, only the people the "Taaalk Owner" (the person who started the Taaalk) chooses can join in the conversation. This keeps things intimate.</p>
      <p><strong>What you say matters (and might embarrass you).</strong> Because of this Taaalk comes with features to make you feel safe sharing your thoughts. Firstly, even if you are not the Taaalk Owner, you can leave a Taaalk and delete all your messages at the same time. The Taaalk will still exist, but what you've written will not. If you are a Taaalk Owner you can delete your Taaalk at any time. You can delete your account, deleting all messages you've written on the Taaalk platform and all the Taaalks you've started at the same time. It's possible to edit or delete an individual message after you have written it. And because it's possible to edit a message after someone has responded to it, we flag up when a message has been edited, so if you are the responder, you don't have to worry about someone changing the question after you've written a response to it. We hope these measures make you feel safe to share yourself on Taaalk, and if you have any more ideas, please come to the <a href="/t/taaalk-feedback">Taaalk feedback conversation</a> to discuss them.</p>
