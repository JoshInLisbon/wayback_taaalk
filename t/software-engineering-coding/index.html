  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't! </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors. </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">There are a number of things that people starting off in a career of Software Engineering should try and keep in mind.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble"><ol>
<li>Never stop learning. Software development is still a very immature discipline. I like to think about it like building jet aeroplanes. After the jet engine was invented, flying on a jet passenger plane was pretty dangerous! Google "the de Havilland Comet". There was so much new engineering that needed to be learnt to get to the point where now it is pretty much the safest mode of transport in the world. The software industry is still building de Havilland Comets to a certain degree. So much is being learnt in terms of best practices, what works and what doesn't. If you don't constantly learn new things, you will be left behind.</li>
<li>You know less than you think. You can wield great power writing software and it can go to your head! Good engineers are humble and never think they either know it all or know better than others.</li>
<li>Stretch yourself. If you know an OOP language, learn a functional one like Elixir or Haskell. If you have spent a lot of time with a very high level language like Python, try Rust. Think of it like a gym. The machine you cant stand the site of is probably the one doing you the most good.</li>
<li>It is an art as well as a science. There is room for beauty and elegance in software.</li>

And it feels confusing because I can do <em>enough to create</em>. I could probably build most things in my mind with Rails and a standard html.erb + scss front end... but while I would learn something, I wouldn't be learning in leaps and bounds in the same way I was when I was learning Ruby/Rails for the first time. I guess what I'm saying is that, in some ways, my ability to create is separated from my need to make drastic educational strides - so it is confusing to know what to focus on.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">If you were in my shoes what would you be optimising for?

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">A good rule of thumb for things like personal projects. If you want to learn something new, build the project with new tools, languages and frameworks. If you want to actually build a project, use what you know. So it depends what the point of the project is. I guess if you want to do both you have to just accept that it will take longer using whatever new shiny stuff you’re using. </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Tech and software engineering has always been obsessed with the new thing. People just can’t help themselves! It’s fine if you’re just working by yourself and playing around with a new language or framework, but if you are making those decisions on behalf of an employer with a large team, you can easily burn millions of pounds by making the wrong choice. The hard part of all this is making consistently right choices given varying contexts and requirements. </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">This goes back to what I was saying about engineering. It is not just coding. It’s the ability to understand a new technology, digest what is good and bad about it, consider it subjectively and then make a decision based on all that information. Good engineers will be good at that, and will be opinionanted about it as well. Being careful and conservative when they need to be, and working on the cutting edge when it makes sense. </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I would recommend not trying to do 4 new things at once. So if you want to learn Flutter or React Native, don’t then something totally foreign for the backend API. Just take it one step at a time. That way you will strike a balance between the fear and excitement of learning something new, and without the admitted drudgery of knocking out features that have no interesting aspects. </div></div>

      <p><strong>So why did Taaalk get built?</strong></p>
      <p>The world is filled with people who know lots of cool stuff and weird things. When it comes to interviews, traditionally it's been the case that a journalist has to take an interest in what you do before you get one. That doesn't happen too often, so it's probably the case that the world is under-interviewed. Taaalk is here to change that. INTERVIEWS FOR EVERYONE.</p>
      <p>But the word "interview" doesn't really capture what Taaalk is about. It's a bit too formal, and implies there is one person with all the knowledge (the interviewee) and another person getting it from them (the journalist/interviewer). Taaalk can be used more flexibly than that. Four people (a Taaalk can have any number of people) who know a lot about a subject can have an extremely nerdy and detailed Taaalk about it. Three people who don't know too much about anything can blab away to each other, just because they enjoy blabbing. And you don't even need to invite anyone to your Taaalk, if you want to write a poem every day, or share a continuous stream of thoughts about a subject of your choice, you can use Taaalk as a place to do that; monologues are a-ok.</p>
      <p>And Taaalk is built for you to be even more creative than that. You can invite yourself to your own Taaalk, change the second-you's details and have an imaginary conversation. You can invite yourself to a Taaalk any number of times, and write a whole play made up of the dialogue of imaginary characters. </p>
      <p><strong>If you don't have anyone to Taaalk with today</strong>, you can leave your details on the <a href="/start-conversation">Start a Conversation</a> page. This means someone looking to Taaalk can introduce themselves to you. And you can introduce yourself to someone else who has left their details.</p>
      <p>More seriously, <strong>we have all grown up in a digital world that is a bit awkward</strong>. In the real world you don't walk around shouting out random facts and opinions, instead you talk to people. And in the real world while you're talking, hundreds of random people don't jump into your conversation. The best chats have a healthy level of intimacy. Taaalk tries to recreate these real world properties online. Firstly, it is all about talking (taaalking). Back and forths. This makes things feel a bit more natural than shouting out snip-its of thoughts and ideas. There's also no character limit and you can save drafts before you reply, so it's a place for deep conversations. You might find that you enjoy Taaalking even if you have normally found yourself to be a bit too shy to fully enjoy other platforms. Secondly, though anyone can read a Taaalk, only the people the "Taaalk Owner" (the person who started the Taaalk) chooses can join in the conversation. This keeps things intimate.</p>
      <p><strong>What you say matters (and might embarrass you).</strong> Because of this Taaalk comes with features to make you feel safe sharing your thoughts. Firstly, even if you are not the Taaalk Owner, you can leave a Taaalk and delete all your messages at the same time. The Taaalk will still exist, but what you've written will not. If you are a Taaalk Owner you can delete your Taaalk at any time. You can delete your account, deleting all messages you've written on the Taaalk platform and all the Taaalks you've started at the same time. It's possible to edit or delete an individual message after you have written it. And because it's possible to edit a message after someone has responded to it, we flag up when a message has been edited, so if you are the responder, you don't have to worry about someone changing the question after you've written a response to it. We hope these measures make you feel safe to share yourself on Taaalk, and if you have any more ideas, please come to the <a href="/t/taaalk-feedback">Taaalk feedback conversation</a> to discuss them.</p>
