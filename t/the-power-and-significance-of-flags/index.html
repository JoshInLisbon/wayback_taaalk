  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Hmmm. That's a good question.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">When I was little, my father used to do Mystery Shopping work on cruise ships so we were always traveling through the Caribbean. Back at home, I can always remember having a large wall map of the world with all those little flags on the bottom. So I think during that time I started making connections between those words on the map (and their respective flags) to the places I went. As I look back, I think that experience gave me a sense of place. That was the key.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So back home, when my eyes looked at maps (and the little flags on the bottom), they made my mind imagine real far away places with interesting cultures and different people. I was an only child so I had to use my imagination a lot more than most kids I guess. That added sense of place and wonder that I was able to connect to those 150+ simple rectangles of color made them infinitely interesting. At an early age I was fascinated at how abstract visual designs could say much more than words.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So maybe flags kicked off my love for design! I'd never thought about that until now but it makes a lot of sense.</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I think the 'sense of place' is interesting, as it frames the flag as something more abstract, than being tied to a fixed location. Delving deeper still, it can also apply to a group of people i.e. gay pride, or religion? (not really sure) Ultimately anything to which people feel a sense of belonging perhaps. What are your thoughts as to kind of situation that a design of a flag would arise? as oppose to say a symbol such as the crucifix or a logo?</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">btw. one of my favourite things about this experiment so far is that people keep realising things, and there's something quite genuinely moving/exciting about that.</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">You are dead on. 95% of the time flags are found as an aspect of identity.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">But what is it about a flag that people easily can so easily attribute a sense of identity as opposed to a logo or a physical object? I think it may have to do with the medium on which the flag's design lives. Cloth has a certain life to it; much more than paper or pixels. As it flies or is waved, it almost has a personality of its own. It can look weak and floppy or strong and confident.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">And flags are designed with that in mind. In fact, Because the fly end of a flag is usually more distorted while flapping in the wind, the rule is to never put any symbol (charge) on that end. They should be reserved for the hoist side which is anchored to the pole and distorts less. That is why you see a lot of flags with the more intricate designs in the canton (the upper left hand corner)(eg. the flag of the United States).</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">On top of that, cloth is accessible. It is one of the most primitive mediums on earth and can be created by just about anyone. It doesn't require intricate printing (well most don't) and all you need to use it is the wind. Because we can identify with cloth, it gives the flag so much power. For instance, burning a piece of paper with a flag on it doesn't have the same emotional response as burning an actual cloth flag. Why? Because cloth has that life, that spark of humanity in it that we empathize and identify with.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">A flag can bring out the deepest emotions from within a person. People will die for a flag, or kill because of one. In many places, certain flags are banned because they pose too great of a threat. Just think about that. A simple piece of dyed cloth…BANNED by a government! That should show the immense power that such a simple design can have.</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Well the oldest "flag-like" things were used by the Chinese. There is evidence of them as far back as 1,500 BC. Then of course the Romans had "standards" which were more like identifiers of military groups and that may have morphed into the era of heraldry in Europe. Some modern flags still have heraldic shields and things on them and the rules of tincture are the basis for modern flag color theory.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">But the event that most modern flags owe their origin to is the creation of the Dutch Prinsenvlag in 1574. It was a horizontal tri-color that was orange, white and blue from top to bottom. That flag is the basis for most flags we see today. It did away with heraldry and went with simple colors that were identifiable from far away (I assume because of the rise in the Dutch Navy and its need to identify ships at long distances). The Dutch flag is still this design, however the orange was changed to red.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Meanwhile, Czar Peter the Great of Russia actually disguised himself and worked in dutch shipyards learning how to build a navy. He was so influenced by this flag that he went back and used it's design in Russia (though he flipped it upside down to be blue, white, red). This color combo came to be the Pan-Slavic colors and you can see them in the modern flags of Russia, Serbia, Czech Republic, et al. The design also went on to influence the french flag during their revolution and many more. In fact, the flag of New York City is orange white and blue, honoring it's Dutch roots.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So the Prinsenvlag's importance on flag design can not be understated. The move from intricate shields that represented personal heritage to ones that denoted military factions and then to the simplest designs that encompassed a massive amount of people birthed the flags we know today.</div></div>

      <p><strong>So why did Taaalk get built?</strong></p>
      <p>The world is filled with people who know lots of cool stuff and weird things. When it comes to interviews, traditionally it's been the case that a journalist has to take an interest in what you do before you get one. That doesn't happen too often, so it's probably the case that the world is under-interviewed. Taaalk is here to change that. INTERVIEWS FOR EVERYONE.</p>
      <p>But the word "interview" doesn't really capture what Taaalk is about. It's a bit too formal, and implies there is one person with all the knowledge (the interviewee) and another person getting it from them (the journalist/interviewer). Taaalk can be used more flexibly than that. Four people (a Taaalk can have any number of people) who know a lot about a subject can have an extremely nerdy and detailed Taaalk about it. Three people who don't know too much about anything can blab away to each other, just because they enjoy blabbing. And you don't even need to invite anyone to your Taaalk, if you want to write a poem every day, or share a continuous stream of thoughts about a subject of your choice, you can use Taaalk as a place to do that; monologues are a-ok.</p>
      <p>And Taaalk is built for you to be even more creative than that. You can invite yourself to your own Taaalk, change the second-you's details and have an imaginary conversation. You can invite yourself to a Taaalk any number of times, and write a whole play made up of the dialogue of imaginary characters. </p>
      <p><strong>If you don't have anyone to Taaalk with today</strong>, you can leave your details on the <a href="/start-conversation">Start a Conversation</a> page. This means someone looking to Taaalk can introduce themselves to you. And you can introduce yourself to someone else who has left their details.</p>
      <p>More seriously, <strong>we have all grown up in a digital world that is a bit awkward</strong>. In the real world you don't walk around shouting out random facts and opinions, instead you talk to people. And in the real world while you're talking, hundreds of random people don't jump into your conversation. The best chats have a healthy level of intimacy. Taaalk tries to recreate these real world properties online. Firstly, it is all about talking (taaalking). Back and forths. This makes things feel a bit more natural than shouting out snip-its of thoughts and ideas. There's also no character limit and you can save drafts before you reply, so it's a place for deep conversations. You might find that you enjoy Taaalking even if you have normally found yourself to be a bit too shy to fully enjoy other platforms. Secondly, though anyone can read a Taaalk, only the people the "Taaalk Owner" (the person who started the Taaalk) chooses can join in the conversation. This keeps things intimate.</p>
      <p><strong>What you say matters (and might embarrass you).</strong> Because of this Taaalk comes with features to make you feel safe sharing your thoughts. Firstly, even if you are not the Taaalk Owner, you can leave a Taaalk and delete all your messages at the same time. The Taaalk will still exist, but what you've written will not. If you are a Taaalk Owner you can delete your Taaalk at any time. You can delete your account, deleting all messages you've written on the Taaalk platform and all the Taaalks you've started at the same time. It's possible to edit or delete an individual message after you have written it. And because it's possible to edit a message after someone has responded to it, we flag up when a message has been edited, so if you are the responder, you don't have to worry about someone changing the question after you've written a response to it. We hope these measures make you feel safe to share yourself on Taaalk, and if you have any more ideas, please come to the <a href="/t/taaalk-feedback">Taaalk feedback conversation</a> to discuss them.</p>
