I'm now a month into being purge free, I have gained weight from it, which i am really struggling with, but being complemented by how much healthier I now look, so i try to remind myself of that.

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">There are many reasons for Ed's. I know for me it was a control issue. There was some trauma in my life that I couldn't deal with but I could control how little I ate, how often I purge, etc. It gave me a way to release what was building up inside. Also it was a way to punish myself because I believed I did something to cause the trauma in the first place. one of the things that drive me nuts is when people just assume you have an Ed because you want to look like a model, it's only a phase, you are attention seeking. Becoming obsessed with weight, how you look, calories, etc is rarely why eds start but more of the symptom. You don't wake up and are like "I need to drop a few pounds before this event so I'm gonna be anorexic". I absolutely hate when people say "just eat. Or it's just a meal. You're missing out this tastes so good" for me if I take that one bite or taste that great dessert my mind will not stop racing with fear, regret, how weak I am for giving in, etc.</div></div>

It's extremely uncommon for someone so young to have their explode from stones but it was a result of rapid weightless, purging etc. No one knew at the time I had an Ed but my aunt whose an rn came to visit and accused me flipping out while my parents were out of the room. I completely denied it. Told my parents she was completely wrong etc. They believed me. About a yr later we were on vacation w my older cousin who is bulimic but was  known about her and after I purged  my mom asked about smell, I blamed cousin (disgusting I'm sorry,) not long after that I passed out during a dance competition, taken to er and I admitted it to a friend who was like a second mom and she helped me tell my parents. I think they knew all along but we're in denial and didn't know how to "fix" me before I told. All the signs were there. Weightless, running any chance I could, became extreme about diets. they had me admitted countless times. I went to college and lived on campus later on. It was close to home but I made them let me experience dorm life. I didn't come home often and one time I did and looked so sick and lied I was doing well. My mom drove to my dorm got let into my room and saw my walls with "thinspo" no food, diet pills galore, etc and that was the first time she was not understanding or willing to try to understand and completely flipped out</div></div>

This would add a psychological idea or two to some of the experiences hat you have had in common (maybe not ideas you have heard before, but ones that I personally have found from dealing with my own experience of mental health issues [I had a lot of anxiety and ~8 years of therapy], and not come across much while studying mental health).</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I'm asking for your permission as, in the same way that I'm sure it's very upsetting/frustrating when someone dismisses your ED by telling you something that you know is not right (e.g. you want to look like a model/you are doing it for them), I think this risks doing that too. From listening to you I do feel there is an idea worth exploring which could explain some parts of developing an ED, but my current explanation of aspects of your ED might be incorrect (like the other explanations you have come across), and I want you to know that I would not be sharing it with a "dictators" mindset, but just as an idea to explore and get feedback on. (It just could also be wrong, and I know that can be upsetting.) So if you would be ok with me discussing it with you, please say so, and if not, please say that too. For me it's not problem whatever you choose.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">(If you do say yes, I might share it in stages because it rests on some ideas that might be important to discuss first.

</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Well the brain is just like that too. But the pressure isn't air pressure; it's emotional pressure. And just like the rules of physics don't care about what people are thinking, even if You* as a person don't decide that you want it to, the brain will try to move your emotional state from one of high pressure to one of low pressure. You have no choice, you are just subject to this process (in the same way you don't get to choose if you obey gravity or not).</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble"><em>*I'm using a capital letter, because the You I'm talking about is the bit you interact with in your own mind (the bit you have discussions with), which even though it can feel like it, might not be the full you. The full you includes all the unconscious processes going on - including the high pressure to low pressure one discussed so far. (Please let me know if this is confusing at all.)</em></div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">And even more strangely, this will still happen even if You don't realise that a lower pressure environment could exist. You might be convinced that things are how they are, but the brain seems to know that it could be more relaxed. The result of this is that a high pressure mental environment is an unstable one. It's obviously not a pleasant one, but what I'm saying is that even if You wanted to keep things in that unpleasant state, the brain would not let you do this easily.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">In fact it becomes increasingly difficult. It's almost like the pressure builds on top of itself to make it harder and harder as time goes on, as if you were trying to pull an air-filled balloon further and further underwater - the deeper you go the harder it is to keep it there and the harder it is to pull it down further.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">What I'm saying is that, if it's before your ED, with your ED, or for someone without an ED, the brain is trying to get to calm. Now there might be reasons why getting to calm/low pressure is very scary (even more scary than staying in the unpleasant state of high pressure/stress), and we will get into the details of how this adds a great deal of friction to the high-to-low process later. But most importantly, as discussed, the physics-like nature of this high-to-low process means that the brain does not care if you are scared or not. It will still try to force its way out of the high pressure environment it is in.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Without getting into how that might relate to an ED, is this making some sense so far?</div></div>

</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">These little humans sure are cute, but they are not able to look after themselves. They are slow. They are weak. They are not very clever. They <strong><em>need</em></strong> other people to take care of them if they are to survive. [And I really want you to think about the word need here. I'm not using it in the casual sense, like "I need a glass of water" or "I need those new shoes" etc. I'm using it in its strongest possible sense. As if you found yourself trapped underwater, you would quickly start to scramble your way to the surface because you and your body know you <strong><em>need</em></strong> air to survive. Or if you had been walking in the desert for days you would <em>actually</em> <strong><em>need</em></strong><em> </em>that glass of water, in a way that you normally don't.]</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So the problem the species faces is: given that every single human out there starts off needing the care and protection of other people, <strong>how do I maximise the probability that weak little humans keep their caregivers around (and keep their caregivers happy, or at least keep them paying enough attention that the little humans survive)?</strong>
</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">And the brain has an excellent solution, or rather a solution that works perfectly well given the limitations on the infant brain. </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Let's first imagine you were an adult and you had this same problem, you could <strong><em>think</em></strong><em> </em>about what the other person wants and <strong><em>act</em></strong><em> </em>in a way that might keep them around. It might be a bit annoying to feign interest in what an uninteresting person says, or to keep the conversation light with someone you know to be easily irritable, but it would be a primarily intellectual exercise - i.e. you would have an internal monologue saying "oh my gosh, this person is soooooo boring" or "damn, this person is so touchy", a comfortable separation between your external expressions and your internal emotions - so while it would be a bit annoying, it (hopefully) wouldn't be too stressful. </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">But look at this:</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">

</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Little kids "hiding"*. <em>They can't see you, so how could you see them?! </em>Little kids do not have very good "<a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/theory-of-mind-4176826">theory of mind</a>", that is the psychological term for ability to think about someone else's mental state. It normally develops seriously between the ages of three and five, and even though that sounds like it's very on in life, it still leaves a healthy chunk of time before it's present; a time when you are at your most vulnerable. So if an infant <strong>can't think</strong> well, it<strong> can't act</strong> well. So the intellectual exercise method (described above) of keeping people there is too big of a risk for the species when it's dealing with its infants. Very little kids can't be trusted to keep themselves alive using that plan, and being alive is what the species wants**</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">*<em>This is a slightly exaggerated example, as I have read that when things are really scary and kids do need to hide, they can do so effectively - but the point about lower levels of cognition when it comes to intellectually predicting the behaviour/thoughts of others is very much true. The "hiding" is just a neat visual example. </em>
</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">**I'm using the "wants" of the species to represent the general theme of evolution: species tend to optimise for their own survival.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So, another plan is needed. And that plan, unfortunately for the adult versions of us that are forced to deal with its consequences, is a distortion of the emotional map.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">The process behind this is quite simple. In the same way that it would be <strong>extremely</strong> stressful if you were trapped underwater, missing the air you <strong>need </strong>to breath, as an infant it is <strong>extremely</strong> stressful if you feel the caregiver you <strong>need </strong>to take care of you is not able to do so in a way that feels right. And the magical trick the infant brain pulls is to attach moments of high stress to deep memory formation***. It does this by filling our brains with certain neurotransmitters (chemicals that help our brains and body adjust to what is going on) when we are stressed, and, as well making our mind's and our body's reaction appropriate, these neurotransmitters result in memories being created.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<em>***</em><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2010.0565"><em>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2010.0565</em></a><em>, this is a good paper with an example for a group of children under one year old learning through stress caused by seemingly mild breakdowns in communication between them and their caregivers.</em>
</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I am sorry this is so long winded, but we must pause for a moment to discuss what memories mean in this context too. I am not talking about your "first memory", I'm talking about a basic reaction forming in your brain. The type of reaction you naturally develop when you burn yourself with a candle flame; flame = bad, avoiding flame = good. It hurts, it's stressful, so don't do it.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So now we are about to get to the interesting stuff, and the stuff that <em>might</em> relate to your situation. Let's say you have a parent who (because of their own strange internal stresses and confusions) can't help but overreact when a child is "bad", and is therefore nice and calm when the child is "good". Even though it might look innocent enough from the outside, as the infant <strong>needs</strong> contented caregivers, the overreaction is going to feel traumatic. A break down in the relationship needed for survival; like someone turning the air off. Traumatic moments mean high stress, and we know that high stress means memory formation. If this pattern of behaviour repeats (the caregiver always acts this way when you are "bad"), this is going to teach the child a very strong lesson: you being bad causes terrible stress 😰, and you being good means things calm 😊; being bad is forbidden, and being good is the only thing that's accepted.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble"><strong>We can watch all this play out on our emotional map:</strong></div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Let's say that the map had territory which made it like so:</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">

<li>The mind naturally wants to go from high emotional pressure (stress) to low emotional pressure (calm)</li>
<li>The best way to do this is to go to the right place on the emotional map (using ALL of your emotions to help you express what you need to).</li>
<li>Not everyone has access to their full emotional map. Due to the caregiver environment we have, we might have to exaggerate some areas and completely ignore others. This means we are not as good at a relieving tension as we could be.</li>
<li>For Stephani, you have an emotional map which allows for a lot of "I'm good" expression, but very little "I'm bad".</li>
</ul></div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So before we tie everything together into a final idea, there is one more important, non-ED, thing to understand about mental health: <strong>mental health is a multiplayer game. </strong>Deep down your brain knows that other people are required to help you solve your mental health problem.<strong></strong>
</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Humans are social beings at their core. It's obvious when we think about other parts of our lives; for example, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/8/11872688/ugly-babies-discrimination">babies are born looking cute because cute features activate instinctual caring attention in adults</a> (the species knows there are other adults about, otherwise babies would not be so cute), <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2663531/">infants naturally focus on faces</a> (or shapes that look like faces), and we are born so weak that we <em>must</em> depend on others (so deep down the species must know that there are other people outside of the womb to depend on).</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">But when we think about mental health, we often think about it as if it's a battle that you are meant to fight alone. It's <em>your</em> mental health right?</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">But just as the infant is not designed to handle infancy in isolation, the process responsible for mending mental health is not one that you are meant to do on your own. How others are used in improving mental health is different from infancy. Mental health problems tend to emerge when the brain thinks the child is at least of "adult" age (this is when core functionalities within the brain are substantially developed, and is around age 13). (This does not mean mental health problems all emerge at age 13, but that they rarely become highly visible beforehand.) Unlike when we are babies, other people are not required to perform the basic caring duties for the 13+ year old dealing with a mental health problem. Instead they are there to gently challenge the individual's thoughts and feelings; highlighting the parts of the sufferer's emotional map that they don't realise they are missing or have exaggerated, so the sufferer can gain some emotional territory back and have improved pressure reducing functionality to help them deal with every day life more easily. </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">It's essential to involve others because the adjustments we have had to make in order to survive childhood in a caregiving environment that can't handle certain emotions took place at the emotional level. This level is extremely deep down. It's so deep down it impacts perception. This means it's extremely hard for you to see where your own emotional map might be distorted as it's (nearly) all you've ever known. And to maximise your chances of survival, everything you feel feels very real to you (even if you consciously know that it doesn't make sense). This means it's almost essential that someone else helps you see where your map is right and where it's gone a bit wrong. <strong>Mental health is multiplayer.</strong>
</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Now because your feelings feel perfectly normal to You (I'm using the same capital-letter-You I defined earlier - the You that you talk to, that might not be the full you), even if they aren't very useful when it comes to high-to-low pressure reduction, You don't know that you need to signal to someone else that the map has gone wrong. So the last important thing to know is <strong>that even without Your conscious consent, your brain is trying to signal to other adults that it is struggling</strong>. It is doing this because a mental health problem is not just for you to solve on your own. Instead it is a group challenge, and even though You don't know it, you are trying to build yourself a group to help tackle it.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">(That mental health is multiplayer might come as a bit of a surprise, but modern society comes as a bit of a surprise to the human brain. While we can conceptualise the fact that we live in big cities and inside closed-off houses, the brain's design took place when we were living in tribes. In a closed-off house in a busy city you mainly are stuck with your parental caregivers up until the age of 18. In a tribe you would have been in regular contact with many people, some of them old and wise; able to pull you aside because they had seen subtle signals that all was not well with your emotions. While your parents might over/under-react to your mental health problem, meaning it's not that useful showing them what's going on, a wise elder member of the tribe might have been very useful to signal to. These signals are not conscious decisions - just like the high-to-low pressure process isn't either. This poor-mental-health-signalling is unconscious and not something You might be aware of.)</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">This brings our final list of concepts to:</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble"><ul>
<li>The mind naturally wants to go from high emotional pressure (stress) to low emotional pressure (calm)</li>
<li>The best way to do this is to go to the right place on the emotional map (using ALL of your emotions to help you express what you need to).</li>
<li>Not everyone has access to their full emotional map. Due to the caregiver environment we have, we might have to exaggerate some areas and completely ignore others. This means we are not as good at a relieving tension as we could be.</li>
<li>For Stephani, you have an emotional map which allows for a lot of "I'm good" expression, but very little "I'm bad".</li>
<li><strong>Mental health is a group process. Emotional map distortions are so "deep down" that other (hopefully wise and kind) people are needed to help solve them. Even though You might not want to, your brain is trying to find a way to communicate that something is not right to the outside world to hopefully begin and/or improve the map readjusting process.</strong></li>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">In a way I am saying that, but with a few added conditions/subtleties.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I'm saying that every human being whose emotional map is not as useful as it could be, and who is not in a successful process of improving it, is unconsciously signalling to the world that things are not right. And both because it is actually the most useful way to signal what is wrong with one's map, as well as being the <strong>only</strong> way to signal what is wrong given the map you have (as the parts you might need to signal differently are missing), the mind will exaggerate the map's distortions until it it becomes clear that something odd is going on in the exaggerator's mind.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">When it comes to a map which contains too much "being good" and doesn't allow any room for "being bad", you only have one tool at your disposal to communicate: being good.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">But it's very difficult to communicate stressful feelings if your only tool is communicating that you are good! So I'm wondering if the only way your mind can signal to the world that it is a space where stress exists and it needs help being allowed to express more of it (i.e. your map is a bit off) is by being <strong>too good</strong>. And we know that your mind thinks <strong>thin = good</strong>. So if your mind needs to send a signal to the world and it can only send "good" signals out, then making you so thin (so good) that other people start to notice that something is wrong is a method to do that.... And it worked... It forced people to take notice of you and start to work on your mind; as you said earlier, it was the eventual discovery of your ED which led to you going to the pediatric psych ED unit.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So now for some sad parts (some more sad parts in what has already, no doubt, been a very difficult story). I believe there are two:</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">The first is that<strong> just because you are discovered, it does not mean that they will treat the right thing</strong>. As a society we have a terrible understanding of mental health. The scientific tribes of psychology love cognitive behavioural therapy, but it normally does not address the right thing, and softer psychotherapists can often miss the mark meaning progress is not made.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">The mind does not make it easy for them; it is filled with so many strong thoughts and ideas that it seems obvious what you need to work on - "you need to learn that it's ok to not be thin", "you need to learn you deserve to have self esteem", etc. But these ideas are not at the core of what is going on (at the core there is the map, and the fears reactions associated to going to forbidden areas of it). So working on what seems obvious to work on does not always result in progress. That is sad. It's sad that even when the immense subconscious struggle to get help has worked, the help it got isn't the help that was needed - so the struggle must go on.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">And the second sad part is that <strong>if other's had been listening more closely to you</strong> (perhaps not to your words, but to <em>all of you</em>), <strong>then the ED would not have been needed</strong>. Remember when you said:</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble"><blockquote>I have always, <strong>even pre Ed</strong>, had  an issue with feeling like my feelings or emotions are invalid. It's def gotten worse though. I apologise a lot if someone feels different than I do. If I'm angry at someone I don't care express it because I don't want to upset anyone</blockquote></div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">(the <strong>bold </strong>is my own emphasis)</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">In this idea we are exploring, an ED is one of the most extreme ways you can communicate by being too good. But I would guess that before your ED, this type of "too good" communication was happening too. But if the main adults that you were coming in to contact with were your caregivers, whose own terrors about your "bad side" caused only "good" to come out of you, then their lack of hearing is no surprise. They were probably extremely pleased to have someone so "good" as their child. But if we could wipe their mind's clean of their unconscious fears about your expression of "bad", or throw in a wise adult who understood that every emotion is ok, then perhaps they would have picked up on all the too-good that was being communicated in a less brutal way than an ED communicates it.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">If they noticed, then they could then have encouraged you to experiment by adding a few more "bad" emotions to your everyday expressions; to get more emotional space on the map for you to live in. They could have helped you to try these scarier "bad" expressions, show you that they can do it too and it's safe, and you could have practiced doing it together in a secure relationship, where you knew they wouldn't mind if your "badness" went too far by mistake. But this did not happen. So if the small signs of too-good are being ignored, the mind must make them bigger and bigger, until they dominate your mind, and an ED is one symptom of that domination.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">At the root of this idea is the need to change your map back. To get more emotionally territory for you to comfortably express. To go from keeping to a tight area on your map:</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">

</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">The ED both communicates what the map looks like (too much "good") and communicates that you need some help, with the hope that you find someone/a group who will help you do the map-rebuilding work that's really needed.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">The result is that this idea has strong views about how to treat an ED: which is to slowly try out more "bad" emotions in the real world and to realise that you can survive their expression; a process which will be very scary at first. There is a more detail to go into when it comes to the treatment side of things that the concepts put forward suggests, but I will stop for now.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">But as I said earlier, this is just an idea - and not precious one - but one to be played with.

      <p><strong>So why did Taaalk get built?</strong></p>
      <p>The world is filled with people who know lots of cool stuff and weird things. When it comes to interviews, traditionally it's been the case that a journalist has to take an interest in what you do before you get one. That doesn't happen too often, so it's probably the case that the world is under-interviewed. Taaalk is here to change that. INTERVIEWS FOR EVERYONE.</p>
      <p>But the word "interview" doesn't really capture what Taaalk is about. It's a bit too formal, and implies there is one person with all the knowledge (the interviewee) and another person getting it from them (the journalist/interviewer). Taaalk can be used more flexibly than that. Four people (a Taaalk can have any number of people) who know a lot about a subject can have an extremely nerdy and detailed Taaalk about it. Three people who don't know too much about anything can blab away to each other, just because they enjoy blabbing. And you don't even need to invite anyone to your Taaalk, if you want to write a poem every day, or share a continuous stream of thoughts about a subject of your choice, you can use Taaalk as a place to do that; monologues are a-ok.</p>
      <p>And Taaalk is built for you to be even more creative than that. You can invite yourself to your own Taaalk, change the second-you's details and have an imaginary conversation. You can invite yourself to a Taaalk any number of times, and write a whole play made up of the dialogue of imaginary characters. </p>
      <p><strong>If you don't have anyone to Taaalk with today</strong>, you can leave your details on the <a href="/start-conversation">Start a Conversation</a> page. This means someone looking to Taaalk can introduce themselves to you. And you can introduce yourself to someone else who has left their details.</p>
      <p>More seriously, <strong>we have all grown up in a digital world that is a bit awkward</strong>. In the real world you don't walk around shouting out random facts and opinions, instead you talk to people. And in the real world while you're talking, hundreds of random people don't jump into your conversation. The best chats have a healthy level of intimacy. Taaalk tries to recreate these real world properties online. Firstly, it is all about talking (taaalking). Back and forths. This makes things feel a bit more natural than shouting out snip-its of thoughts and ideas. There's also no character limit and you can save drafts before you reply, so it's a place for deep conversations. You might find that you enjoy Taaalking even if you have normally found yourself to be a bit too shy to fully enjoy other platforms. Secondly, though anyone can read a Taaalk, only the people the "Taaalk Owner" (the person who started the Taaalk) chooses can join in the conversation. This keeps things intimate.</p>
      <p><strong>What you say matters (and might embarrass you).</strong> Because of this Taaalk comes with features to make you feel safe sharing your thoughts. Firstly, even if you are not the Taaalk Owner, you can leave a Taaalk and delete all your messages at the same time. The Taaalk will still exist, but what you've written will not. If you are a Taaalk Owner you can delete your Taaalk at any time. You can delete your account, deleting all messages you've written on the Taaalk platform and all the Taaalks you've started at the same time. It's possible to edit or delete an individual message after you have written it. And because it's possible to edit a message after someone has responded to it, we flag up when a message has been edited, so if you are the responder, you don't have to worry about someone changing the question after you've written a response to it. We hope these measures make you feel safe to share yourself on Taaalk, and if you have any more ideas, please come to the <a href="/t/taaalk-feedback">Taaalk feedback conversation</a> to discuss them.</p>
