  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Hello Tom. I agree with your point about psychedelic being politically driven rather than scientifically driven. Recently there has been a shift in focus from driving this new psychedelic renaissance from a scientific perspective. That is a good question I would say most of the doctors that have access to them due so because they support them. However, the stigma that still surrounds them might cause them to ignore them. Also, compared to other medications for mental health there is still a dearth of information regarding the efficacy of these psychedelics for Mental Health. Another thing is that psychedelic medication to not fit with the traditional assembly line like practices of many practitioners.Â </div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Hi Jeff, thanks for your response! I find it interesting you bring up the juxtaposition between standardized modern medicine (particularly western medicine) and what the future of medicine might become through a psychedelic lense. You also mentioned an excellent point regarding our collective lack of current data on psychedelic medicines, as well as the production issue surrounding them. Even with so little data on psychedelics, I find it curious that they aren't more seriously considered as a potential tool in the world of mental health. Particularly when there's considerable data on the effects of antidepressants and the harm they cause to patients, even if the intially intended effect of reducing emotional response is achieved. I'd like to dive a bit deeper into these issues, but first I'd love to hear your opinions on the current attitudes towards psychedelic medicine by general practitioners. What do you see as the most common attitude towards these medicines when you speak with other professionals? Furthermore, what do you consider to be the biggest hurdle obstructing psychedelic medicine from becoming a topic to be taken seriously by the average medical professional?</div></div>

      <p><strong>So why did Taaalk get built?</strong></p>
      <p>The world is filled with people who know lots of cool stuff and weird things. When it comes to interviews, traditionally it's been the case that a journalist has to take an interest in what you do before you get one. That doesn't happen too often, so it's probablyÂ the case that the world is under-interviewed. TaaalkÂ is here to change that. INTERVIEWS FOR EVERYONE.</p>
      <p>But the word "interview" doesn't really capture what TaaalkÂ is about. It's a bit too formal, and implies there is one person with all the knowledge (the interviewee) and another person getting it from them (the journalist/interviewer). TaaalkÂ can be used more flexiblyÂ than that. Four people (a TaaalkÂ can have any number of people) who know a lot about a subject can have an extremely nerdy and detailed Taaalk about it. Three people who don't know too much about anything can blab away to each other, just because they enjoy blabbing. And you don't even need to invite anyone to your Taaalk, if you want to write a poem every day, or share a continuousÂ stream of thoughts about a subject of your choice, you can use Taaalk as a place to do that; monologues are a-ok.</p>
      <p>And TaaalkÂ is built for you to be even more creative than that. You can invite yourself to your own Taaalk, change the second-you's details and have an imaginary conversation. You can invite yourself to a Taaalk any number of times, and write a whole play made up of the dialogue of imaginary characters.Â </p>
      <p><strong>If you don't have anyone to TaaalkÂ with today</strong>, you can leave your details on the <a href="/start-conversation">Start a Conversation</a> page. This means someone looking to TaaalkÂ can introduce themselves to you. And you can introduce yourself to someone else who has left their details.</p>
      <p>More seriously, <strong>we have all grown up in a digital world thatÂ is a bit awkward</strong>. In the real world you don't walk around shouting out random facts and opinions, instead you talk to people. And in the real world while you're talking, hundreds of random people don't jump into your conversation. The best chats have a healthy level of intimacy. TaaalkÂ tries to recreate these real world properties online. Firstly, it is all about talking (taaalking). Back and forths. This makes things feel a bit more natural than shouting out snip-its of thoughts and ideas. There's also no character limit and you can save drafts before you reply, so it's a place for deep conversations. You might find that you enjoy TaaalkingÂ even if you have normally found yourself to be a bit too shy to fully enjoy other platforms. Secondly, though anyone can read a Taaalk, only the people the "TaaalkÂ Owner" (the person who started the Taaalk) chooses can join in the conversation. This keeps things intimate.</p>
      <p><strong>What you say matters (and might embarrass you).</strong> Because of this TaaalkÂ comes with features to make you feel safe sharing your thoughts. Firstly, even if you are not the TaaalkÂ Owner, you can leave a Taaalk and delete all your messages at the same time. The Taaalk will still exist, but what you've written will not. If you are a TaaalkÂ Owner you can delete your Taaalk at any time. You can delete your account, deleting all messages you've written on the Taaalk platform and all the Taaalks you've started at the same time. It's possible to edit or delete an individual message after you have written it. And because it's possible to edit a message after someone has responded to it, we flag up when a message has been edited, so if you are the responder, you don't have to worry about someone changing the question after you've written a response to it. We hope these measures make you feel safe to share yourself on Taaalk, and if you have any more ideas, please come to the <a href="/t/taaalk-feedback">TaaalkÂ feedback conversation</a> to discuss them.</p>
