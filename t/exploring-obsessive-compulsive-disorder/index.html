Well, most of them... I never cared much for dogs, and their mere presence began to provoke a horrible, raw anxiety that I had never felt before.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">It sounds silly, I know. But imagine five large dogs in one small household... it was incredibly unhygienic. My dog-avoidance Obsession rapidly escalated. Then, it expanded to include all of the people in the house -- my family.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">At that point, with my triggers being dogs and my own family members, I spiraled fast and hard. I lost basic freedoms. I threw out most of my furniture, stopped walking on my carpet, stopped washing my laundry, and more, all to avoid contact with that which my brain deemed a threat.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">In my experience, my OCD onset was insidious and all-consuming. It sprang from nothing, and then it became everything.</div></div>

Does the consequence of ignoring the internal pressure to perform a ritual drive you to do it, and if so what is that consequence?

It's the closest I've ever felt to pure insanity.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">On a thoughts-related note: Some thoughts, called "intrusive thoughts", do not feel natural at all. Their mere presence provokes terrible dysphoria. Their content often comes in the form of spontaneous, vivid mental imagery. Without fail, they are <em>always</em> horrifying, unwanted, and unexpected.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">It's as if my brain crafts these images specifically to torment me. Everyone with OCD or intrusive thoughts "see" different things. Personally, I most often see my loved ones harmed in some way. Evisceration, enucleation, decapitation, immolation... Sometimes by their hand, sometimes by mine, and I'm not sure which one is worse. I've also seen a lot of brutal self-harm and freak accidents that are even freakier than Final Destination. (The story-driven video game "Neverending Nightmares", which is made by an Obsessive-Compulsive, perfects captures the self-harm "visions" I see.)</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">And sometimes intrusive thoughts come in the form of literal thoughts, such as, "What if I (blank)? What if I jam this knife in my neck? What if I pour drain cleaner in my coffee? What if I threw a lit match on this propane tank?" I'd best describe this brand of intrusive thoughts as being similar to the phenomenon named "the call of the void", except instead of feeling the urge to do it, I obsessively ask myself <em>if I feel</em> the urge to do it. I never do. OCD basically interrogates me, haha. This can go on for hours.</div></div>

I understand that it's all due to the lack of proper education, and inaccurate representations in media, but honestly, it does make me feel bitter.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">The idea that OCD is anything other than a debilitating mental disorder is deeply harmful.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I've been told outright by one psychologist that "Everyone has OCD, it doesn't really require treatment." The same psych also ranted about how OCD shouldn't be diagnosable...  This psych was heralded as a prodigy and was well-respected by all. How, I will never know.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Goes to show that the public's bias also affects "professional" minds, to startling degrees.

Another kept referring to my contaminant as "germs", despite my persistent correction.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Collectively, they never addressed it as a disorder.

Stereotyping seemed to fuel most of it, and yet, communication did not mitigate the issue, because their minds were apparently made - OCD is normal! Disregard the "D", I guess.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Of course, that's all blatant misunderstanding. It can be more subtle than that, in which case, communication typically serves. Though no matter what, I still get the underlying feeling that there exists a barrier between me and everyone else. Or like the assortment of words I am using is, in actuality, total nonsense, and that they're just nodding in agreement to make me feel better. I guess that's the feeling of spouting insanity.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">That isn't to say that it's a useless endeavor.

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Sure. In theory, surrounding myself with other sufferers should give me a sense of relief, since we're speaking the same language. And it does - briefly. But I find that, in turn, it makes me feel more isolated in my day-to-day life. I've struggled for years to explain my OCD to the people around me, but they still don't understand even the basics. Their lack of comprehension impacts my life the most, and on a daily basis, and therefore, it'd bring the greatest relief if they were the ones who understood what I was going through.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Also... Something that I experience on online forums is a... fear(?) that I <em>am</em> the other posters. That I... I don't know, blacked out, and created other accounts to converse with. Of course, this is ridiculous! I wouldn't do such a thing, but OCD makes me question if I did. "Maybe it happened. I can't prove it hasn't." I'm sure this impacts how I feel about other people online, which likely affects how "real" and "meaningful" interactions with them are.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I get a lot of these little pseudo-delusions (thought distortions? not sure if there's a clinical term). I had an awfully vivid one recently, where the phone in my hotel room only worked one way (they could hear me, but I couldn't hear them). This lead me to question if, perhaps, I had died and didn't yet know it. (I had sleep paralysis the night before, with a figure beside me telling me "You're going to die," which didn't help, haha.)</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">That is an extremely interesting answer. What I find most interesting about it is how everything you define in the Support section could neatly map onto a healthy childhood environment.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">There was an excellent child psychotherapist called Dr. Winnicott, who came up with a term called "holding". It is not to do with physically holding the child, but to do with the environment that the child is in. Does the environment "hold" them, in which case the child spends it's time "being" (this is that lovely feeling of not paying attention to outside worries, and getting lost in whatever activity is in front of you); or does the environment fail to "hold" the child, in which case the child experiences "annihilation" (which is the disruption from that beautiful feeling of being safe and allowing yourself to be lost in whatever you're doing; when the child is annihilated it needs to "wake up" from being to manage the environment as the environment isn't a safe one to be in).</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">These words, "being" and "annihilation", are remarkably heavy. And that is because the mind of an infant is that fragile. For the infant's mind to form with calm defaults in place it does need a lot of "being" time, and the infant's mind will both crave and feed from a good holding environment as if it were a form of nutrition. Whilst if the infant is forced to wake up from being to take control of what is going on it is terribly disruptive and lays the seed for mental health problems later in life.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">When I go through your Support section, the key themes would make for a healthy holding environment: </div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble"><blockquote>--- <strong>Support:</strong><br>- Accepting that the sufferer's experiences are real <em>to them.</em> Nobody should berate or shame an OCD sufferer for the content of their Obsessions -- no matter how ridiculous, impossible, scary, or disgusting they sound.</blockquote></div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Do not shame the child, respect them.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble"><blockquote>
<strong>-</strong> Recognizing that people can't be forced into recovery, and that unwilling/forced exposure (i.e., to a contaminant) is not conducive to recovery. If a sufferer is not ready and willing for exposure therapy, they should not be tormented by others "for their own good".</blockquote></div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Do not rush the child, be patient with them.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble"><blockquote>
<strong>-</strong> Acknowledging that <strong>A)</strong> Nobody intentionally develops or fabricates OCD, and therefore shouldn't be blamed for having it (it's an illness, not a character flaw); <strong>B)</strong>Nobody is defined by the content of their intrusive thoughts and/or Obsession themes (e.g., racist, pedophilic, homicidal, unfaithful); and <strong>C)</strong> In general, no amount of therapy and/or medication can render somebody permanently asymptomatic. (Barring some rare cases.)</blockquote></div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Do not judge the child for its imagination, allow it to get lost in play.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble"><blockquote>
<strong>-</strong> Ignoring reassurance-seeking.</blockquote></div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Do not overreact to the child, calmly be there with them as they go through their stress. Do not make the stress more real than it is.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">If you imagine an environment where, no matter how wild and outlandish the child's thoughts, feelings or behaviours (and children do have wild and outlandish ideas - getting extremely upset/scared about things an adult knows are not important), the child was respected, responded to calmly and uncritically, and allowed to get lost in worlds of its own, without being ripped out of them; this would constitute a good holding environment.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Whereas what you mention in your Enablement section would constitute some "false positive"* aspects of an environment that was not a holding one; mainly overreaction ("Agreeing to perform a ritual", "Making extensive/exhaustive accommodation") and not knowing how to really express care ("Giving reassurance. It only grants temporary relief while reinforcing the OC cycle."), instead of "holding" you through your stressful experiences.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble"><em>* I use the words "false positive" here as a caregiver might feel that over reacting or being reassuring in an unsatisfactory way are what the child needs, however it is very rarely the case. More often than not behaviours like these reflect anxieties present in the caregiver's mind.</em></div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">You do not mention the overtly negative parts (e.g. a judgemental/shaming environment), but we were discussing good and bad forms of support.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I don't want to push you to a place which is uncomfortable, so only do the following if you would like to. I wonder what you find when you reflect on your own childhood and the holding environments you had. Do you feel that you were held adequately, so that you were generally lost in being, or does it feel like a space where the caregivers disrupted you, so you had to stop being in order to "manage" them, meaning some annihilation took place?</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Ah, okay. Unfortunately, I don't have any safe method of hooking up my contaminated camera to my uncontaminated laptop. Well, that's an idea for the future.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Honestly, at this point, my rituals have naturally integrated themselves into my life. In-home rituals especially; there's no build-up, and very little stress, as I always feel I am in control and am capable of avoiding mistakes.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Public rituals are a different story. My most involved ritual is performed at the public laundromat... Although, it could be argued that the ritual actually begins when I wake up that morning.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">There's a lot of details to cover, and all are relevant to the ritual and/or my OC mind process. I'll try to make it easy to follow, but this... will be long, and probably boring!</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble"><strong>Ritual end-goals:</strong></div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Part 1- Make it to the laundromat with <em>at least</em> mostly un-contaminated hands.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Part 2- Complete my laundry.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Supplies I must have (all un-opened): Antibacterial soap (for laundry and hands), garbage bags, box of gloves.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Okay, <strong>start</strong>! I wake up (of course) and get cleaned up. At this stage, there is no bodily contamination.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I get dressed, making sure my hair is tied back securely and my headband is folded right and fitted (not likely to slip). This is important, since my hair must never come loose and dangle out, lest it become contaminated. My hoodie ties must also be kept inside for the same reason.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">For each hand, I grasp my hoodie's sleeve and push it deep into a glove, then double the glove. If the glove cuffs are not long/tight enough to hold my sleeve, I tie or tape them. (If I tie them, I have to take scissors with me to the laundromat.) Choice of tie/tape depends on what supplies I have available at the time.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Last garment on is my shoes, which are very contaminated. Once I reach this point, 3 things are important: I have officially crossed into the contaminated zone; I have utterly contaminated my gloves (since they touched my shoes); and I can no longer cross back/touch anything that is un-contaminated.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Also, note that while I am outfitted properly to traverse contaminated environments, I still must not allow too much contamination of my clothing - most of all, my hood (which comes into contact with my face and hair). Movement is stiff and calculated.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">With my laundry &amp; supplies in tow, I lock up and leave.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Once I arrive to the laundromat and take everything inside, these are my steps:</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<strong>1.</strong> Set up my "area". I always use the same spot to place my supplies. It's basically my "Hub" for the duration of my stay: Folding tables, a little shelf, and a chair.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<strong>2.</strong> Start putting laundry into machines - MUST be done one article at a time. (Note: They are front-facing washing machines, meaning I must crouch.) I ball up the articles and pass them through the machine's opening cleanly, without allowing either the article or my arms to touch the opening. The opening is already contaminated by proxy of being in public; however, I do not wish to contaminate it further, in case of accidental contact. The less contaminated it is, the less I'd have to wash if I accidentally touched it.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<strong>3.</strong> Go retrieve change from the coin machine. I cup one hand down low, against my stomach, to carry the coins back to my Hub, and place them in a bag, which I flatten. This is important since I don't want the bag to touch me when I reach in later.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<strong>4.</strong> Soap &amp; coins go into the washing machines - nothing special here. Start the machines.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<strong>5.</strong> Ready my supplies - I open my gloves and garbage bags carefully, pulling the box flaps open but never touching the contents. I set them down for later use.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<strong>6.</strong> Now, let's just say that earlier in the morning, I taped my glove cuffs (instead of tying them). So my hoodie is basically like an upper-body onesie right now, haha. I loosen each glove by gripping close to the cuff (but not past it) and wriggling. I alternate until they're both ready to slip off. I retract my right arm into the hoodie and pull the zipper down from there (tricky!). I retract my left arm and grip the hoodie with both hands from the inside of the shoulder regions... Is this making sense...? I push the hoodie off towards my back, careful not to drag my headband off.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<strong>7.</strong> Now I'm wearing my undershirt, tucked into my pants. Sleeves are not compatible with this ritual, so I needed to take my hoodie off.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<strong>8.</strong> I go to the sink and wash my hands and a portion of my arms, until it feels right. I must not touch the sink (if I do accidentally, I must re-wash). When I am done, I leave the sink running and skip over to my Hub to grab a glove from the box I opened earlier, careful not to touch the outside of the box. I glove a hand and use it to turn off the sink. Then I strip off the glove and take a seat to wait. While sitting, I cannot lean back, since that would cause my hair and neck to become contaminated. And my arms must be kept in this position: Elbows touching my stomach, hands straight out and up in front of me, where they cannot come into contact with my contaminated clothing. I call it the surgeon position, haha. (Right now, my pants are VERY contaminated, and my shirt is ambiguous. It was mostly protected by my hoodie, but not quite enough.)</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<strong>9.</strong> Maintaining this position is strenuous and very uncomfortable! But I must. Once the washing machines stop, I glove a hand to open them, secure the door positions (wide open), open a dryer (also wide open), strip the glove, and begin transporting the clothes. Crouch -&gt; shove arms together (I mustn't touch the opening) -&gt; ball up one article - &gt; remove carefully -&gt; put the article in dryer. Repeat until empty.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<strong>10.</strong> I glove a hand to administer the quarters and strip off the glove. Now the dryers are running and I must begin prepping my bags, which my dry laundry will go into. One caveat: I have to double the bag, and all without letting the bags touch ANYTHING. I remove the roll of garbage bags without touching the outside of the box. With my arms extended far in front of me, I unroll one bag with my left hand, gripping the roll in my right hand, and I place the roll inside the now-open bag. I turn to face my Hub and place the bag-containing-bags down carefully, making an oval shape with the opening. I did this so that I could easily access my garbage bag roll.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<strong>11.</strong> If my arms/shoulders cramped during this, I take a minute to recover. I grab one bag, open it (without letting it come into contact with anything at all) and then ball it up in my right hand. Still holding the first bag, I then grab a second bag and open that one too. I place the balled-up bag inside the other, lining them up. Now the doubled-up bag is ready to be placed down in my Hub. I am again careful and make an oval-shaped opening, not letting the opening of the bag touch the table.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<strong>12.</strong> I repeat step 11 to make enough. By this point, the dryers are probably done. I glove a hand to open the doors and then strip off the glove. Noticing a pattern? Ha. One article at a time, I place my dried laundry into the bags I prepped. I lift the bag from the inside with each article added, to evenly distribute the weight and ensure the bag remains upright, and also to readjust the position of the opening. My clothes must not touch the outside of the bag. (Touching the immediate opening is okay, anything lower than that is not since it has made direct contact with the table.) The only article left out is a new, clean hoodie, which I will need to put on before leaving.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<strong>13.</strong> When all clothing is bagged, I tie the innermost bag tight, put on the new hoodie, and then tie the outer bag tight. I do it in that order because the outer bag is contaminated, and I don't want to contaminate my hands/arms before putting on the hoodie.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">
<strong>14.</strong> Final stretch!! I glove both hands and use any excess bags to fortify my laundry bags (3+ bags for each "sack" is ideal, in the case of snags or tears, to protect the innermost bag. Any puncture that reaches all the way will ruin the entire bag of laundry; it'd have to be re-washed.) I haphazardly grab my stuff - no real boundaries here, now, since my laundry and myself are protected - and the ritual is complete. Until the next one, anyway. I have many micro-rituals throughout the day, but few are as long-winded as laundry and showers.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Do you regret asking? Hahaha. And yes, my laundry IS wrinkly from being shoved into bags.</div></div>

      <p><strong>So why did Taaalk get built?</strong></p>
      <p>The world is filled with people who know lots of cool stuff and weird things. When it comes to interviews, traditionally it's been the case that a journalist has to take an interest in what you do before you get one. That doesn't happen too often, so it's probably the case that the world is under-interviewed. Taaalk is here to change that. INTERVIEWS FOR EVERYONE.</p>
      <p>But the word "interview" doesn't really capture what Taaalk is about. It's a bit too formal, and implies there is one person with all the knowledge (the interviewee) and another person getting it from them (the journalist/interviewer). Taaalk can be used more flexibly than that. Four people (a Taaalk can have any number of people) who know a lot about a subject can have an extremely nerdy and detailed Taaalk about it. Three people who don't know too much about anything can blab away to each other, just because they enjoy blabbing. And you don't even need to invite anyone to your Taaalk, if you want to write a poem every day, or share a continuous stream of thoughts about a subject of your choice, you can use Taaalk as a place to do that; monologues are a-ok.</p>
      <p>And Taaalk is built for you to be even more creative than that. You can invite yourself to your own Taaalk, change the second-you's details and have an imaginary conversation. You can invite yourself to a Taaalk any number of times, and write a whole play made up of the dialogue of imaginary characters. </p>
      <p><strong>If you don't have anyone to Taaalk with today</strong>, you can leave your details on the <a href="/start-conversation">Start a Conversation</a> page. This means someone looking to Taaalk can introduce themselves to you. And you can introduce yourself to someone else who has left their details.</p>
      <p>More seriously, <strong>we have all grown up in a digital world that is a bit awkward</strong>. In the real world you don't walk around shouting out random facts and opinions, instead you talk to people. And in the real world while you're talking, hundreds of random people don't jump into your conversation. The best chats have a healthy level of intimacy. Taaalk tries to recreate these real world properties online. Firstly, it is all about talking (taaalking). Back and forths. This makes things feel a bit more natural than shouting out snip-its of thoughts and ideas. There's also no character limit and you can save drafts before you reply, so it's a place for deep conversations. You might find that you enjoy Taaalking even if you have normally found yourself to be a bit too shy to fully enjoy other platforms. Secondly, though anyone can read a Taaalk, only the people the "Taaalk Owner" (the person who started the Taaalk) chooses can join in the conversation. This keeps things intimate.</p>
      <p><strong>What you say matters (and might embarrass you).</strong> Because of this Taaalk comes with features to make you feel safe sharing your thoughts. Firstly, even if you are not the Taaalk Owner, you can leave a Taaalk and delete all your messages at the same time. The Taaalk will still exist, but what you've written will not. If you are a Taaalk Owner you can delete your Taaalk at any time. You can delete your account, deleting all messages you've written on the Taaalk platform and all the Taaalks you've started at the same time. It's possible to edit or delete an individual message after you have written it. And because it's possible to edit a message after someone has responded to it, we flag up when a message has been edited, so if you are the responder, you don't have to worry about someone changing the question after you've written a response to it. We hope these measures make you feel safe to share yourself on Taaalk, and if you have any more ideas, please come to the <a href="/t/taaalk-feedback">Taaalk feedback conversation</a> to discuss them.</p>
