  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">We play because it is one of the dominant modes of learning for the human animal. We have a huge instinctual love for learning...we can't help ourselves. Arguably these naked, clawless apes are only successful as a species due to our mastery of tools, language and social skills. These let us adapt to our highly variable landscape in an unprecedented fashion. We can learn these through essential skills rote learning by reading books or gossiping with one another. But we can can also learn by playing.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Play is exploratory learning. You see something, you fiddle with it and see what it does. Using what you've learned, you try something else. Along the way, you build up a remarkably rich mental structure for how the thing works and how it might be used productively. That moment of discovery when you figure how a thing does something interesting...that's delight...that's fun! Laughter while playing is a sign of insight.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Now, while you are playing, it may seem totally useless to the more serious minded folks. You flounder about and fail a ton. You make mistakes. It takes immense leisure time. But all this playful effort ends up building out the paths of understanding. Wisdom gained through play doesn't look like knowing a single way to do something successfully. It is knowing all the ways things can go horribly wrong and knowing how to adapt. Exploratory learning yields flexible skills. That's super valuable.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So where do games come into all this? Games are merely structured play. They are a way of sharing play with others; a game says "Hey! Here's a fruitful form of play!" This usually takes the form of a process defined rules and actions that people should carry out. Over time (or by intentional design) the rules are edited and pared down to be something that can be easily explained while still offering a rich and delightful play space. Just as novels are a highly edited and transferable form of grass roots gossip, games are a highly edited and transferable form of play.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Just as it is extremely difficult to stop play from happening, it ends up being very difficult stopping humans from playing games. It is part of who we are as an organism.</div></div>

Flappy Birds focuses on physical skill. Expert players need to master the brutal physics and random map generation. The short loop of trail and inevitable failure means you get a lot of practice in a short amount of time. It isn't for everyone and deals with a narrow set of skills. But I suspect that there are a vast number of players who have been getting incrementally better over months of play. Chess has years of learning in it, but the skills it exercises are more about pattern recognition and memorization (of opening moves).</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">There's often a certain amount of snobbery in our discussions of 'deep' vs 'shallow'. Not all players like the same things and there are many orthogonal play styles for even the same game. A haphazard social game of chess with take-backs and gossip may be a wonderful way to spend an afternoon for friends. They are more interested in building a relationship with one another than mastering a game. They might find harshly competitive chess downright insulting; a betrayal of the trust in one another they are building. Instead of asking whether a game is shallow or deep on some ideal scale, I like to instead ask 'What value do you get out of a game?'</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">That's a much more personal question. It leaves room for different people with different needs. And it leaves room for lots of different types of meaningful games.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I'm honestly still mystified by what games players will play 6 months after they first try it. I've actually built a lot of my career and designs around 'evergreen' games. These are the sort of game that people play for years. So I have patterns and black magic rituals. I know how players burn out on certain types of content. And I know how we can employ various mathematical structures to maintain variety and engagement. But in the end, it is still a bit of a crap shoot.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Games are human processes. We are codifying play in rules and mechanical systems, but ultimately you need to have those run on human wetware. I don't have a compiler manual for the human brain. It's a complex, messy system with highly variable quality control. I can write the most pristine code but as soon as I get a player executing those instructions things often go wildly off the rails. Imagine a computer that instead of executing your program decides to pop off to the fridge and get a yogurt. This is why play testing is so critically important to any game development process. You literally cannot develop a functioning game unless you run it with real people and see how they react.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Getting that human brain to execute your game for 6 months? Hoo boy! Most of our work goes into getting you to play for 30 seconds. Learning is part of it. The player's needs, mental resources and expectations matter too. All these factors are hidden until you test the game. You slowly tease them out over hundreds or thousands of iterations, all while retuning your game to fit what you've learned as the designer.</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Although I think humans are hard to understand, I believe that there are consistencies across us. Going back to the Flappy Bird vs chess debate; if we're playing games because we learn through them, do you feel that all forms of learning have the same weight?</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">This is just my personal perspective, but I feel that pattern recognition (and memory exercise) has a greater transferable use in day to day life than the physical mastering of random map generation. Do you think that's at all the case? And if you do, would it be fair to presume that a game which taught more commonly used transferable skills would have better retention?</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">There's actually considerably uncertainty about what transfer from games into the real world. Definitely an ongoing topic of research with more questions than answers. My simple rule of thumb is that <strong>generalized</strong> skills seem to transfer more than <strong>specific</strong> skills.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">What does that mean?</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Let's look at 'specific skills' first. It helps to understand that games are these little self contained pocket universes; more abstract mathematical toys than scientific models of the real world. Greg Costikyan use the phrase 'endogenous systems of value'. So what do skills in a game represent? They represent us getting better at manipulating this little abstract toy.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">You see this argument pop up with regards to violence in games. To a game player that is deep within the mathematical pocket universe of a game, shooting an enemy the head has nothing to do with the real world act of shooting someone in the head. Instead, they are concerned with timing sequences, controller manipulation and abstraction resource payoffs within the game's internally coherent value structure. There's this moment in most games where advanced players 'see the Matrix', strip away the evocative media and just start manipulating numbers and game concepts.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">But if that is the case, where do all the theoretical evolutionary benefits for play come from? It seems that exercising specific game skills does accidentally exercise overlapping general skills. It is sort of like how doing pushing ups will indeed make you better at pushups, but also will end up making your arms stronger overall. For example, playing action games results in surgeons become more accurate and faster when performing surgeries. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427052023/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17309970">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17309970</a>) The specific skills of shooting virtual enemies overlapped with the general skills of performing rapid, high accuracy tasks.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">That was a very surprising result and it makes me wary of jumping to conclusion on how any specific game might or might not be helpful. We are incredibly bad at reasoning about how the brain works...we tend to rely on wildly inaccurate just-so models. For example, we'll happily accept that a fictional shooting activity obviously must results in a real world lust for killing. It is ripping tale, despite being false...I'd repeat that to my favorite aunt in a heartbeat! She needs know. But we'll ignore the functional components of attention management and timing that go into that same 'shooting game' skill. Those micro-moments of second-to-second experience are deeply boring and don't make for good gossip. So we don't talk about them. But that's what is actually happening and where all the skill transfer magic is occurring.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So I wouldn't write off Flappy Bird quite yet, especially if you engage in any real-world fine motor control activities.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Chess...is complex. It happens to be as much a social game as it is a game about thinking. So chess players get this wonderful burst of bonding with other people over a common interest. And it sets up social norms for a group where thinking and planning are celebrated. So something as mundane as a chess club end up seeding a new community. And we've suddenly gone beyond simple games and fallen headfirst into the creation of culture.</div></div>

      <p><strong>So why did Taaalk get built?</strong></p>
      <p>The world is filled with people who know lots of cool stuff and weird things. When it comes to interviews, traditionally it's been the case that a journalist has to take an interest in what you do before you get one. That doesn't happen too often, so it's probably the case that the world is under-interviewed. Taaalk is here to change that. INTERVIEWS FOR EVERYONE.</p>
      <p>But the word "interview" doesn't really capture what Taaalk is about. It's a bit too formal, and implies there is one person with all the knowledge (the interviewee) and another person getting it from them (the journalist/interviewer). Taaalk can be used more flexibly than that. Four people (a Taaalk can have any number of people) who know a lot about a subject can have an extremely nerdy and detailed Taaalk about it. Three people who don't know too much about anything can blab away to each other, just because they enjoy blabbing. And you don't even need to invite anyone to your Taaalk, if you want to write a poem every day, or share a continuous stream of thoughts about a subject of your choice, you can use Taaalk as a place to do that; monologues are a-ok.</p>
      <p>And Taaalk is built for you to be even more creative than that. You can invite yourself to your own Taaalk, change the second-you's details and have an imaginary conversation. You can invite yourself to a Taaalk any number of times, and write a whole play made up of the dialogue of imaginary characters. </p>
      <p><strong>If you don't have anyone to Taaalk with today</strong>, you can leave your details on the <a href="/start-conversation">Start a Conversation</a> page. This means someone looking to Taaalk can introduce themselves to you. And you can introduce yourself to someone else who has left their details.</p>
      <p>More seriously, <strong>we have all grown up in a digital world that is a bit awkward</strong>. In the real world you don't walk around shouting out random facts and opinions, instead you talk to people. And in the real world while you're talking, hundreds of random people don't jump into your conversation. The best chats have a healthy level of intimacy. Taaalk tries to recreate these real world properties online. Firstly, it is all about talking (taaalking). Back and forths. This makes things feel a bit more natural than shouting out snip-its of thoughts and ideas. There's also no character limit and you can save drafts before you reply, so it's a place for deep conversations. You might find that you enjoy Taaalking even if you have normally found yourself to be a bit too shy to fully enjoy other platforms. Secondly, though anyone can read a Taaalk, only the people the "Taaalk Owner" (the person who started the Taaalk) chooses can join in the conversation. This keeps things intimate.</p>
      <p><strong>What you say matters (and might embarrass you).</strong> Because of this Taaalk comes with features to make you feel safe sharing your thoughts. Firstly, even if you are not the Taaalk Owner, you can leave a Taaalk and delete all your messages at the same time. The Taaalk will still exist, but what you've written will not. If you are a Taaalk Owner you can delete your Taaalk at any time. You can delete your account, deleting all messages you've written on the Taaalk platform and all the Taaalks you've started at the same time. It's possible to edit or delete an individual message after you have written it. And because it's possible to edit a message after someone has responded to it, we flag up when a message has been edited, so if you are the responder, you don't have to worry about someone changing the question after you've written a response to it. We hope these measures make you feel safe to share yourself on Taaalk, and if you have any more ideas, please come to the <a href="/t/taaalk-feedback">Taaalk feedback conversation</a> to discuss them.</p>
