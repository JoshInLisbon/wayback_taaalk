  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Well this function is very useful.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">It is there to help the mind avoid what it finds scary. Even though the thoughts sound like they are very different, they share the same structure.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">The thoughts are always about the *future* and the thoughts are always bad enough that it makes the individual having them want to take *protective behaviour*.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Scared of how the queue pusher will react? <em>Don't say anything.</em>
</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Scared of what your friend will do? <em>Don't bring it up.</em>
</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Scared of the plane crashing? <em>Don't stay on it.</em>
</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">This is very useful <strong>if the thing you are scared about is a thing that is 'reasonable/healthy' to be scared about.</strong>
</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">There is a crazy person with a gun... <em>Hide from them/don't upset them. </em>Very reasonable.<strong></strong>
</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">However, the HUGE<strong> </strong>problem with being a human is that <strong>what is 'reasonable/healthy' to be scared about changes over time. </strong>And whilst what is reasonable/healthy to be scared about changes, <strong>our fears don't change as the</strong><strong><em> need for our fears</em></strong><strong> changes.</strong>
</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Go back in time to when you were an infant. Back then you had to be scared about things that are not important now, because you were very different than you are now. You could not look after yourself, you needed the attention of your parents to survive. So you needed to be scared about them abandoning you, about them getting angry with you, about them being distracted and worried, about them neglecting you.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">That is not true for you today. Now that you are an adult that parental attention / distraction / neglect is not a life and death matter.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">And your brain is built to deal with the ugly reality of this, by having a system in place to teach you 'parebt calming' patterns of behaviour from an extremely early age.The neurological experience of stress and memory formation go hand in hand. There is a chemical in the brain called norepinephrine. When you are scared your brain becomes flooded with it. And when your brain is flooded with it, a strong memory is formed.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Let's say you are an infant and mum keeps getting upset every time you speak up in front of others, or dad gets upset every time you show weakness - <strong>POW</strong> - because your parents love, stability and attention is vital for your survival, you are scared to disrupt it - so your child brain becomes flooded with norepinephrine, and a new fear-memory forms. <em>I should not speak up in front of others. I should not show weakness.</em>
</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">That is great for you to learn because it will keep your parents calm...<em></em>
</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">But when you are older, it's no longer true. It doesn't really matter what people/your parents think of you/feel about you when you can survive on your own. As an adult what you'll find is the discomfort that comes with keeping all of those reasonable feelings inside matters more. But it's very hard to, or rather it's not obvious how to, escape the fears that were programmed into us when we were very young. It's very easy to not feel comfortable standing up for yourself, or expressing weakness. These are the things that people go to therapy to deal with.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So while anxious mind-wandering can be useful if the fear is a sensible one, it is very easy for us to have fears in our head which are not sensible. And we can't help but anxiously mind-wander about them.</div></div>

      <p><strong>So why did Taaalk get built?</strong></p>
      <p>The world is filled with people who know lots of cool stuff and weird things. When it comes to interviews, traditionally it's been the case that a journalist has to take an interest in what you do before you get one. That doesn't happen too often, so it's probablyÂ the case that the world is under-interviewed. TaaalkÂ is here to change that. INTERVIEWS FOR EVERYONE.</p>
      <p>But the word "interview" doesn't really capture what TaaalkÂ is about. It's a bit too formal, and implies there is one person with all the knowledge (the interviewee) and another person getting it from them (the journalist/interviewer). TaaalkÂ can be used more flexiblyÂ than that. Four people (a TaaalkÂ can have any number of people) who know a lot about a subject can have an extremely nerdy and detailed Taaalk about it. Three people who don't know too much about anything can blab away to each other, just because they enjoy blabbing. And you don't even need to invite anyone to your Taaalk, if you want to write a poem every day, or share a continuousÂ stream of thoughts about a subject of your choice, you can use Taaalk as a place to do that; monologues are a-ok.</p>
      <p>And TaaalkÂ is built for you to be even more creative than that. You can invite yourself to your own Taaalk, change the second-you's details and have an imaginary conversation. You can invite yourself to a Taaalk any number of times, and write a whole play made up of the dialogue of imaginary characters.Â </p>
      <p><strong>If you don't have anyone to TaaalkÂ with today</strong>, you can leave your details on the <a href="/start-conversation">Start a Conversation</a> page. This means someone looking to TaaalkÂ can introduce themselves to you. And you can introduce yourself to someone else who has left their details.</p>
      <p>More seriously, <strong>we have all grown up in a digital world thatÂ is a bit awkward</strong>. In the real world you don't walk around shouting out random facts and opinions, instead you talk to people. And in the real world while you're talking, hundreds of random people don't jump into your conversation. The best chats have a healthy level of intimacy. TaaalkÂ tries to recreate these real world properties online. Firstly, it is all about talking (taaalking). Back and forths. This makes things feel a bit more natural than shouting out snip-its of thoughts and ideas. There's also no character limit and you can save drafts before you reply, so it's a place for deep conversations. You might find that you enjoy TaaalkingÂ even if you have normally found yourself to be a bit too shy to fully enjoy other platforms. Secondly, though anyone can read a Taaalk, only the people the "TaaalkÂ Owner" (the person who started the Taaalk) chooses can join in the conversation. This keeps things intimate.</p>
      <p><strong>What you say matters (and might embarrass you).</strong> Because of this TaaalkÂ comes with features to make you feel safe sharing your thoughts. Firstly, even if you are not the TaaalkÂ Owner, you can leave a Taaalk and delete all your messages at the same time. The Taaalk will still exist, but what you've written will not. If you are a TaaalkÂ Owner you can delete your Taaalk at any time. You can delete your account, deleting all messages you've written on the Taaalk platform and all the Taaalks you've started at the same time. It's possible to edit or delete an individual message after you have written it. And because it's possible to edit a message after someone has responded to it, we flag up when a message has been edited, so if you are the responder, you don't have to worry about someone changing the question after you've written a response to it. We hope these measures make you feel safe to share yourself on Taaalk, and if you have any more ideas, please come to the <a href="/t/taaalk-feedback">TaaalkÂ feedback conversation</a> to discuss them.</p>
