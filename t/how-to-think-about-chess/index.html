  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Everyone has an opening repertoire. Many people just have one answer for each question they might reasonably expect their opponents to ask, which means they get very good at playing those answers, but equally become very predictable. There are some openings that are razor sharp and precise, and require knowing many 15-20 move variations in order to not get destroyed without the game even starting. I personally prefer openings that are more conceptual, which tend to be slightly more flexible, require much less knowledge, but arguably lead to somewhat more boring positions because of this.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">So when the middlegame comes around, it's probably the kind of position I've played many times before. My strategy is usually to throw lots of pieces at their king and hope they die or I can win some material. Since I'm hoping to win at this point, I probably don't start thinking explicitly about the endgame until little suggestions of things that might become relevant start cropping up. So if pawns become isolated or doubled, or we end up with opposite colored bishops, or with a bishop on the same color square as most of our pawns, etc. If I can take one of these small positional advantages then I will, and then effectively "bank" it until the endgame actually comes around. Having one or more of these might make me more likely to head towards an endgame too.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Endgames are really hard and require a lot of technique that I don't really have. Fortunately most other people don't either, because you just don't get to play that many of them.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">It probably is fair to say that I'm pretty aware of the opening/middlegame/endgame distinction. The opening is where I'm playing pretty much from memory, the middlegame is where I try and win, and the endgame is what I might head towards if I think I have a tangible advantage but try and avoid otherwise.</div></div>

In which case won't most games have one? I know in the extremely amateur world of chess that I play in that most games come to a end where one side is actively checkmated. Is the endgame more unusual the higher up you go because a party will often resign when one side is in a dominant position?</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">I guess this is a question for statistics to answer properly, but my gut says that there possibly are fewer endgames in higher level play. If you lose a bishop or a knight without any obvious compensation, you will almost definitely resign on the spot. That said, it's probably also true that fewer boneheaded mistakes mean that neither side may have had much of a chance to win before the endgame. Overall I'm not sure!</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">But when I say "might head towards the endgame", I mean that I might deliberately choose to swap off pieces and accelerate progress towards the end of the game. If I'm a pawn up then trading off pieces is likely a huge win for me, because whilst a queen + 2 rooks + 1 bishop + 2 knights + 7 pawns v the same but 6 pawns is not a huge advantage, a bishop + 5 pawns v a bishop + 4 pawns probably is. Small material advantages are a much bigger deal in the endgame and leave less room for your opponent to generate compensation, so if you are slightly ahead then deliberately swapping off pieces is very important. Games can naturally meander towards an endgame where neither side is too psyched about their chances, or they can be forced.</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">Honestly I like openings that allow you to put your pieces on nice squares without thinking too hard, and then throw them all at your opponent's king. This is not a very sophisticated strategy, but it can be very hard to deal with if you aren't prepared (this is a good example). If you can get off the beaten track without doing anything too insane then you become much more familiar with the kinds of positions that result than your opponents, and develop a big box of patterns that have worked in the past.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">This becomes somewhat less effective the higher level and more famous you get, as you start to become notorious for particular openings, and opponents can start preparing counters to them. This is where a degree of flexibility and unpredictability becomes invaluable, so that your opponents can't just put all their time into preparing for your Stonewall Dutch or Trompowsky, and also have to keep in mind that you might throw in a Benko Gambit or English Opening. It can be worthwhile playing these alternatives in high profile tournaments that will get their games into databases that your future opponents will see and get confused and upset by.</div></div>

A rook or bishop in the corner can still rake across the entire board, but a knight in the same spot looks pretty dumb.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">2) If you want to attack the king (I do), you need to have your pieces attacking him and the squares around him!

This is the most direct way for your rooks to influence the game. As mentioned above, you don't necessarily need to be destroying or capturing anything in order for your pieces to be making your opponents' life awkward, so principles like "rooks on open files" will almost always be good things to at least look out for.</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">The more experienced the players, the bigger the difference between playing white and black. At the very very highest levels winning with black is really quite an impressive achievement, and black will often go into a game playing for a draw. The advantage of the first move is very pronounced, and sets the tone for the entire game, with white generally calling the shots. Attempts by black to generate active counterplay are often very risky. At lower levels, black can afford to be a bit more ambitious without worrying too much about opening up tiny weaknesses that get ruthlessly exploited.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">The more you actively engage with your opponent's pieces and position early on, the less (generally speaking) time you are spending on getting your pieces out and putting them exactly where you want them. This potentially creates weaknesses of your own. So the sharper and more confrontational the variations you want to play, the more opening theory you need to know to make sure you don't do anything that is already known to be a mistake. I don't like opening theory (because I'm a lazy player), so I tend to err on the side of just trying to do my own thing whilst making small prods at my opponent here and there. This is definitely a deficiency in my game though, and means that I'm rarely asking particularly difficult questions of my opponents in the opening.</div></div>

So you might be developing your pieces and attacking their pawns, or seizing the centre and cramping them for space, or tying their pieces down to defending each other. None of these efforts are likely to immediately cause checkmate, but they are still "attacking" in the sense that they force defensive responses from your opponent. It's rare that you will sound the charge with a specific move, but more often you'll gradually build up the pressure, without giving your opponent a chance to respond</div></div>

They are very focused on my own structure and normally all take place within my half of the board. So when I'm playing there's normally a move where the pressure goes 'on'. That's normally when I force a direct defensive response from my opponent (i.e. do something or your piece will die!). I'll do this early if I notice a mistake in their play and at some random point if nothing obvious emerges.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">It sounds like when you're opening the pressure is always on. In your opening phase what is the balance like of moves that are more internally focused (although they might be gaining you space in the middle of the board / be generally 'aggressive') and moves that force a direct defensive response?</div></div>

  <div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">It 100% depends on the opening variation. In the sharp but almost definitely technically unsound Muzio Gambit, white sacrifices a knight on move 5 and is attacking until they either win or run out of pieces from then on. Whereas in a Stonewall Dutch, black is almost definitely just going to play most of f5/e6/Nf6/d5/Bd6/0-0/c6/Nbd7/Ne4/Ndf6/Bd7/Be8/Bh5 and then look up and see what white has been up to.</div></div><div class="tlk-bubble-holder"><div class="tlk-bubble">A move that asks your opponent questions obviously doesn't have to be overtly aggressive as such. At higher levels of play, getting a knight to a good square or forcing someone to trade off a "good" bishop can be non-trivial wins, so moving your knight to a square where it might next turn be able to hop into a hole in the centre can constitute a "question", or moving a pawn so that next go you might be able to kick their bishop and force it to trade with your bishop. When there are more possible small wins, there are more possible ways to threaten these small wins. When you're just starting out, as long as your opponent isn't directly threatening to take one of your pieces for free or checkmate you, you probably don't have to worry too much about them gaining a microscopic positional advantage.</div></div>

      <p><strong>So why did Taaalk get built?</strong></p>
      <p>The world is filled with people who know lots of cool stuff and weird things. When it comes to interviews, traditionally it's been the case that a journalist has to take an interest in what you do before you get one. That doesn't happen too often, so it's probably the case that the world is under-interviewed. Taaalk is here to change that. INTERVIEWS FOR EVERYONE.</p>
      <p>But the word "interview" doesn't really capture what Taaalk is about. It's a bit too formal, and implies there is one person with all the knowledge (the interviewee) and another person getting it from them (the journalist/interviewer). Taaalk can be used more flexibly than that. Four people (a Taaalk can have any number of people) who know a lot about a subject can have an extremely nerdy and detailed Taaalk about it. Three people who don't know too much about anything can blab away to each other, just because they enjoy blabbing. And you don't even need to invite anyone to your Taaalk, if you want to write a poem every day, or share a continuous stream of thoughts about a subject of your choice, you can use Taaalk as a place to do that; monologues are a-ok.</p>
      <p>And Taaalk is built for you to be even more creative than that. You can invite yourself to your own Taaalk, change the second-you's details and have an imaginary conversation. You can invite yourself to a Taaalk any number of times, and write a whole play made up of the dialogue of imaginary characters. </p>
      <p><strong>If you don't have anyone to Taaalk with today</strong>, you can leave your details on the <a href="/start-conversation">Start a Conversation</a> page. This means someone looking to Taaalk can introduce themselves to you. And you can introduce yourself to someone else who has left their details.</p>
      <p>More seriously, <strong>we have all grown up in a digital world that is a bit awkward</strong>. In the real world you don't walk around shouting out random facts and opinions, instead you talk to people. And in the real world while you're talking, hundreds of random people don't jump into your conversation. The best chats have a healthy level of intimacy. Taaalk tries to recreate these real world properties online. Firstly, it is all about talking (taaalking). Back and forths. This makes things feel a bit more natural than shouting out snip-its of thoughts and ideas. There's also no character limit and you can save drafts before you reply, so it's a place for deep conversations. You might find that you enjoy Taaalking even if you have normally found yourself to be a bit too shy to fully enjoy other platforms. Secondly, though anyone can read a Taaalk, only the people the "Taaalk Owner" (the person who started the Taaalk) chooses can join in the conversation. This keeps things intimate.</p>
      <p><strong>What you say matters (and might embarrass you).</strong> Because of this Taaalk comes with features to make you feel safe sharing your thoughts. Firstly, even if you are not the Taaalk Owner, you can leave a Taaalk and delete all your messages at the same time. The Taaalk will still exist, but what you've written will not. If you are a Taaalk Owner you can delete your Taaalk at any time. You can delete your account, deleting all messages you've written on the Taaalk platform and all the Taaalks you've started at the same time. It's possible to edit or delete an individual message after you have written it. And because it's possible to edit a message after someone has responded to it, we flag up when a message has been edited, so if you are the responder, you don't have to worry about someone changing the question after you've written a response to it. We hope these measures make you feel safe to share yourself on Taaalk, and if you have any more ideas, please come to the <a href="/t/taaalk-feedback">Taaalk feedback conversation</a> to discuss them.</p>
