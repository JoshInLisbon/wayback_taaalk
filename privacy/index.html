  <p>Taaalk is a trading name for Joshua Summers Consulting Ltd. The Taaalk platform is a demonstration of technology and product design skills used in order to obtain business for Joshua Summers Consulting Ltd. In this document, Taaalk refers to the legal entity Joshua Summers Consulting Ltd.</p>

  <p>Company Number: 11221495</p>

  <p>Registered office address:</p>

  <p>PO Box BN1 6AF, First Floor, Telecom House, 125-135 Preston Road, Brighton, East Sussex, United Kingdom, BN1 6AF</p>

  <p>The terms Taaalk, Taaalks, taaalk, taaalks and conversations are used interchangeably for conversations/monologues created using the Taaalk Services.</p>

  <p>Taaalk Privacy Policy</p>

  <p>1.1 Basic Account Information</p>

  <p>You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public Taaalk profiles or reading conversations. If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On Twitter this includes a display name (for example, “Joe Blogs”), a password, and an email address or phone number. In future this may include a username so users can communicate directly with you through a mention, e.g “hi @JoeBlogs”) Your display name is  always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can also create and manage multiple Taaalk accounts, for example to express different parts of your identity. You can create multiple conversation participants (Speakers) from the same account, even within the same conversation. Each Speaker can have its own profile photo, name and bio. Speakers can be pseudonyms. DO NOT IMPERSONATE/USER AS A PSEUDONYM ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT AS A SPEAKER IN A CONVERSATION, THIS WILL BE SEEN TO BE A VIOLATION OF OUR TERMS.</p>

  <p>Your email is saved as a string in our database. This means it may be read by staff members and visible to hackers, should we be hacked. If data is accidentally leaked then it may also become publicly visible. It will not be shared with any external party without your consent. There are no current intentions to share your email with any third party. The privacy policy will be updated, and you shall be notified, if this changes. </p>

  <p>1.2 Public Information</p>

  <p>Most activity on Taaalk is public, including your profile information, your time zone and language, when you created your account, and your Taaalk and their messages and certain information about your Taaalks like the date, time, and application and version of Taaalk you interacted on. You also may choose to publish your location or your Taaalk profile. In future, the lists you create, accounts you follow and conversations you follow and who follows you and your conversations may become public. If you like, reply, or otherwise publicly engage with an ad on our services, that advertiser might thereby learn information about you associated with the ad with which you engaged such as characteristics of the audience the ad was intended to reach. Your hearts/likes, comments, the number of hearts you’ve received may also become public. Information posted about you by other people who use our services may also be public. </p>

  <p>You are responsible for your Taaalks and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on Taaalk, such as by deleting your account, we will reflect your updated content on our Services. If external services (such as https://archive.org/web/) have scraped content/conversations publicially available on Taaalk and stored it/made it public, we will not be held responsible for the existance of this content. </p>

  <p>By publicly posting content when you Taaalk, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible, including through our APIs, and directing those accessing the information through our APIs to do the same. To facilitate the fast global dissemination of Taaalks to people around the world, we may use technology like application programming interfaces (APIs) and embeds to make that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use - for example, displaying a Taaalk on a news website or analyzing what people say on Taaalk. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this data can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with Taaalk, and their offerings may not reflect what you have written/posted/uploaded on Taaalk. </p>

  <p>1.3 Contact Information and Address Books</p>

  <p>We may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to authenticate your account and keep it - and our services - secure, and to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse. We may also use contact information to enable certain account features (for example, for login verification via SMS), and to send you information about our services, and to personalize our services, including ads. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from Taaalk to that number as your country’s laws allow. Though we do not do so currently, and have no plans to do so currently, Taaalk may also use your contact information to market to you as your country’s laws allow, and to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications. </p>

  <p>In future, you may choose to upload and sync your address book on Taaalk so that we can help you find and connect with people you know and help others find and connect with you. We also use this information to better recommend content to you and others.</p>

  <p>If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to your request and/or save your email/message for future use and/or internal discussion.</p>

  <p>1.4 Public Communications</p>

  <p>Taaalk has no private messaging feature. Assume all things written on Taaalk excluding your email address and password (as used to sign up) are publicly visible. </p>

  <p>1.5 Payment Information</p>

  <p>In future, you may provide us with payment information6, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address, in order to purchase advertising/sponsor a Taaalk/sponser a user or other offerings provided as part of our services. Payments will likely be processed with an external payment processor (such as Stripe). This information will be updated then.</p>

  <p>Additional Information We Receive About You</p>

  <p>2.1 Google analytics, or another analytics program, may be used to track your use of the website. This may include location information based on your IP address. Currently analytics are not used on the site. </p>

  <p>2.2 There is a view count on every conversation page. This tracks the loading of the page. No personal information is stored in relation to the view count.</p>

  <p>Links</p>

  <p>2.3 You can click links on Taaalk. These links can be to other pages on our site or to external sources. If you click on a link to an external source the external source may see that you came from the Taaalk website. If you click internal links we might track your movement across our website to better understand how you use it. </p>

  <p>Cookies</p>

  <p>2.4 A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device. Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our services such as searching and looking at public profiles. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer. However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies. When your browser or device allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences. We do not support the Do Not Track browser option. </p>

  <p>Log Data</p>

  <p>We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our services, which we refer to as “Log Data,” even if you have not created an account. For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party service, or visit a third-party service that includes Taaalk content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data includes information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms (including those not submitted as queries), and cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through Taaalk. We use Log Data to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. In future, we may also use this data to improve the content we show you, including ads and to improve the effectiveness of our own marketing.</p>

  <p>We use information you provide to us and data we receive, including Log Data and data from third parties, to make inferences like what topics you may be interested in, how old you are, and what languages you speak. This helps us better promote and design our services for you and personalize the content we show you, including ads.</p>

  <p>2.6 Advertisers and Other Ad Partners</p>

  <p>We do not currently allow advertising on our site. The following information is set out for future possibilities, should advertising be placed on the Taaalk website. Advertising revenue would allow us to support and improve our services. We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads. Our ad partners and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device IDs, hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by Taaalk from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with Taaalk and that Taaalk receives about you described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.</p>

  <p>Service Providers</p>

  <p>We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in Germany, the United Kingdom, and other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal data with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions (service providers may use other non-personal data for their own benefit). If we one day take payment, we will share your payment information with payment services providers to process payments; prevent, detect, and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities; facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds; and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit and debit cards.</p>

  <p>Law, Harm, and the Public Interest</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or controls we may otherwise offer to you, we may preserve, use, or disclose your personal data or other safety data if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services, or to explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of those who use our services. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your personal data.</p>

  <p>Affiliates and Change of Ownership</p>

  <p>In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your personal data may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal data as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose personal data about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help operate our services and our affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.</p>

  <p>Non-Personal Information</p>

  <p>We share or disclose non-personal data, such as aggregated information like the total number of times people engaged with a Taaalk, demographics, the number of people who clicked on a particular, or reports to advertisers about how many people saw or clicked on their ads.</p>

  <p>Deleting Your Data</p>

  <p>Your account can be deleted on your user page. You will need to have javascript enabled to do this. On deletion any conversations started by you and any messages written by you in other conversations, but not the conversations themselves, will be permanently deleted. We hold no responsibility to obtain these deleted records for you after deletion.</p>

      <p><strong>So why did Taaalk get built?</strong></p>
      <p>The world is filled with people who know lots of cool stuff and weird things. When it comes to interviews, traditionally it's been the case that a journalist has to take an interest in what you do before you get one. That doesn't happen too often, so it's probably the case that the world is under-interviewed. Taaalk is here to change that. INTERVIEWS FOR EVERYONE.</p>
      <p>But the word "interview" doesn't really capture what Taaalk is about. It's a bit too formal, and implies there is one person with all the knowledge (the interviewee) and another person getting it from them (the journalist/interviewer). Taaalk can be used more flexibly than that. Four people (a Taaalk can have any number of people) who know a lot about a subject can have an extremely nerdy and detailed Taaalk about it. Three people who don't know too much about anything can blab away to each other, just because they enjoy blabbing. And you don't even need to invite anyone to your Taaalk, if you want to write a poem every day, or share a continuous stream of thoughts about a subject of your choice, you can use Taaalk as a place to do that; monologues are a-ok.</p>
      <p>And Taaalk is built for you to be even more creative than that. You can invite yourself to your own Taaalk, change the second-you's details and have an imaginary conversation. You can invite yourself to a Taaalk any number of times, and write a whole play made up of the dialogue of imaginary characters. </p>
      <p><strong>If you don't have anyone to Taaalk with today</strong>, you can leave your details on the <a href="/start-conversation">Start a Conversation</a> page. This means someone looking to Taaalk can introduce themselves to you. And you can introduce yourself to someone else who has left their details.</p>
      <p>More seriously, <strong>we have all grown up in a digital world that is a bit awkward</strong>. In the real world you don't walk around shouting out random facts and opinions, instead you talk to people. And in the real world while you're talking, hundreds of random people don't jump into your conversation. The best chats have a healthy level of intimacy. Taaalk tries to recreate these real world properties online. Firstly, it is all about talking (taaalking). Back and forths. This makes things feel a bit more natural than shouting out snip-its of thoughts and ideas. There's also no character limit and you can save drafts before you reply, so it's a place for deep conversations. You might find that you enjoy Taaalking even if you have normally found yourself to be a bit too shy to fully enjoy other platforms. Secondly, though anyone can read a Taaalk, only the people the "Taaalk Owner" (the person who started the Taaalk) chooses can join in the conversation. This keeps things intimate.</p>
      <p><strong>What you say matters (and might embarrass you).</strong> Because of this Taaalk comes with features to make you feel safe sharing your thoughts. Firstly, even if you are not the Taaalk Owner, you can leave a Taaalk and delete all your messages at the same time. The Taaalk will still exist, but what you've written will not. If you are a Taaalk Owner you can delete your Taaalk at any time. You can delete your account, deleting all messages you've written on the Taaalk platform and all the Taaalks you've started at the same time. It's possible to edit or delete an individual message after you have written it. And because it's possible to edit a message after someone has responded to it, we flag up when a message has been edited, so if you are the responder, you don't have to worry about someone changing the question after you've written a response to it. We hope these measures make you feel safe to share yourself on Taaalk, and if you have any more ideas, please come to the <a href="/t/taaalk-feedback">Taaalk feedback conversation</a> to discuss them.</p>
