  <p>In consideration for Taaalk granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Taaalk and its third-party providers and partners may place advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others. You also agree not to misuse our Services, for example, by interfering with them or accessing them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide.

  <p>You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public Taaalk profiles or reading conversations. If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On Twitter this includes a display name (for example, “Joe Blogs”), a password, and an email address or phone number. In future this may include a username so users can communicate directly with you through a mention, e.g “hi @JoeBlogs”) Your display name is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can also create and manage multiple Taaalk accounts, for example to express different parts of your identity. You can create multiple conversation participants (Speakers) from the same Taaalk account, even within the same conversation. Each Speaker can have its own profile photo, name and bio. Speakers can be pseudonyms. DO NOT IMPERSONATE/USER AS A PSEUDONYM ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT AS A SPEAKER IN A CONVERSATION, THIS WILL BE SEEN TO BE A VIOLATION OF OUR TERMS.</p>

  <p>People can post/use urls on Taaalk. These maybe concealed by text (for example the word “Bing” could link to “https://google.com”). We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from clicking on urls which do not have clear wording above them.</p>

  <p>Your Account</p>

  <p>You may need to create an account to use some of our Services. You are responsible for safeguarding your account, so use a strong password and limit its use to this account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above. </p>

  <p>You can control most communications from the Services by following or unfollowing Taaalks and users, and leaving/joining Taaalks. We may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving them. If you added your phone number to your account and you later change or deactivate that phone number, you must update your account information to help prevent us from communicating with anyone who acquires your old number. We currently do not collect phone numbers and any phone number written in your bio is your own responsibility.</p>

  <p>We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from the publication and/or loss of personal information relating to your account that may arise from technical error or malicious attack or any other means. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage to reputation arising from Content posted on our platform in your name/about you.

  <p>Ending These Terms</p>

  <p>You may end your legal agreement with Taaalk at any time by deleting your account(s) and discontinuing your use of the Services. Your account can be deleted on your user page. You will need to have javascript enabled to do this. On deletion any conversations started by you and any messages written by you in other conversations, but not the conversations themselves, will be permanently deleted. We hold no responsibility to obtain these deleted records for you after deletion. </p>

  <p>We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to unlawful conduct, (iv) your account should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (v) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable.

  <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, which will always be at taaalk.co/terms, will govern our relationship with you. Other than for changes addressing new functions or made for legal reasons, we will notify you 1 day in advance of making effective changes to these Terms that impact the rights or obligations of any party to these Terms, for example via a service notification or an email to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>

  <p>In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Taaalk’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

  <p>These Terms are an agreement between you and Joshua Summers Consulting Ltd. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact eichler [dot] summers [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>

      <p><strong>So why did Taaalk get built?</strong></p>
      <p>The world is filled with people who know lots of cool stuff and weird things. When it comes to interviews, traditionally it's been the case that a journalist has to take an interest in what you do before you get one. That doesn't happen too often, so it's probably the case that the world is under-interviewed. Taaalk is here to change that. INTERVIEWS FOR EVERYONE.</p>
      <p>But the word "interview" doesn't really capture what Taaalk is about. It's a bit too formal, and implies there is one person with all the knowledge (the interviewee) and another person getting it from them (the journalist/interviewer). Taaalk can be used more flexibly than that. Four people (a Taaalk can have any number of people) who know a lot about a subject can have an extremely nerdy and detailed Taaalk about it. Three people who don't know too much about anything can blab away to each other, just because they enjoy blabbing. And you don't even need to invite anyone to your Taaalk, if you want to write a poem every day, or share a continuous stream of thoughts about a subject of your choice, you can use Taaalk as a place to do that; monologues are a-ok.</p>
      <p>And Taaalk is built for you to be even more creative than that. You can invite yourself to your own Taaalk, change the second-you's details and have an imaginary conversation. You can invite yourself to a Taaalk any number of times, and write a whole play made up of the dialogue of imaginary characters. </p>
      <p><strong>If you don't have anyone to Taaalk with today</strong>, you can leave your details on the <a href="/start-conversation">Start a Conversation</a> page. This means someone looking to Taaalk can introduce themselves to you. And you can introduce yourself to someone else who has left their details.</p>
      <p>More seriously, <strong>we have all grown up in a digital world that is a bit awkward</strong>. In the real world you don't walk around shouting out random facts and opinions, instead you talk to people. And in the real world while you're talking, hundreds of random people don't jump into your conversation. The best chats have a healthy level of intimacy. Taaalk tries to recreate these real world properties online. Firstly, it is all about talking (taaalking). Back and forths. This makes things feel a bit more natural than shouting out snip-its of thoughts and ideas. There's also no character limit and you can save drafts before you reply, so it's a place for deep conversations. You might find that you enjoy Taaalking even if you have normally found yourself to be a bit too shy to fully enjoy other platforms. Secondly, though anyone can read a Taaalk, only the people the "Taaalk Owner" (the person who started the Taaalk) chooses can join in the conversation. This keeps things intimate.</p>
      <p><strong>What you say matters (and might embarrass you).</strong> Because of this Taaalk comes with features to make you feel safe sharing your thoughts. Firstly, even if you are not the Taaalk Owner, you can leave a Taaalk and delete all your messages at the same time. The Taaalk will still exist, but what you've written will not. If you are a Taaalk Owner you can delete your Taaalk at any time. You can delete your account, deleting all messages you've written on the Taaalk platform and all the Taaalks you've started at the same time. It's possible to edit or delete an individual message after you have written it. And because it's possible to edit a message after someone has responded to it, we flag up when a message has been edited, so if you are the responder, you don't have to worry about someone changing the question after you've written a response to it. We hope these measures make you feel safe to share yourself on Taaalk, and if you have any more ideas, please come to the <a href="/t/taaalk-feedback">Taaalk feedback conversation</a> to discuss them.</p>
