Many people just have one answer for each question they might reasonably expect their opponents to ask, which means they get very good at playing those answers, but equally become very predictable. There are some openings that are razor sharp and precise, and require knowing many 15-20 move variations in order to not get destroyed without the game even starting. I personally prefer openings that are more conceptual, which tend to be slightly more flexible, require much less knowledge, but arguably lead to somewhat more boring positions because of this.</p></div>

My strategy is usually to throw lots of pieces at their king and hope they die or I can win some material. Since I'm hoping to win at this point, I probably don't start thinking explicitly about the endgame until little suggestions of things that might become relevant start cropping up. So if pawns become isolated or doubled, or we end up with opposite colored bishops, or with a bishop on the same color square as most of our pawns, etc. If I can take one of these small positional advantages then I will, and then effectively "bank" it until the endgame actually comes around. Having one or more of these might make me more likely to head towards an endgame too.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>Endgames are really hard and require a lot of technique that I don't really have. Fortunately most other people don't either, because you just don't get to play that many of them.</p></div>

The opening is where I'm playing pretty much from memory, the middlegame is where I try and win, and the endgame is what I might head towards if I think I have a tangible advantage but try and avoid otherwise.</p></div>

In which case won't most games have one? I know in the extremely amateur world of chess that I play in that most games come to a end where one side is actively checkmated. Is the endgame more unusual the higher up you go because a party will often resign when one side is in a dominant position?</p>

If you lose a bishop or a knight without any obvious compensation, you will almost definitely resign on the spot. That said, it's probably also true that fewer boneheaded mistakes mean that neither side may have had much of a chance to win before the endgame. Overall I'm not sure!</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>But when I say "might head towards the endgame", I mean that I might deliberately choose to swap off pieces and accelerate progress towards the end of the game. If I'm a pawn up then trading off pieces is likely a huge win for me, because whilst a queen + 2 rooks + 1 bishop + 2 knights + 7 pawns v the same but 6 pawns is not a huge advantage, a bishop + 5 pawns v a bishop + 4 pawns probably is. Small material advantages are a much bigger deal in the endgame and leave less room for your opponent to generate compensation, so if you are slightly ahead then deliberately swapping off pieces is very important. Games can naturally meander towards an endgame where neither side is too psyched about their chances, or they can be forced.</p></div>

This is not a very sophisticated strategy, but it can be very hard to deal with if you aren't prepared (this is a good example). If you can get off the beaten track without doing anything too insane then you become much more familiar with the kinds of positions that result than your opponents, and develop a big box of patterns that have worked in the past.</p></div>

This is where a degree of flexibility and unpredictability becomes invaluable, so that your opponents can't just put all their time into preparing for your Stonewall Dutch or Trompowsky, and also have to keep in mind that you might throw in a Benko Gambit or English Opening. It can be worthwhile playing these alternatives in high profile tournaments that will get their games into databases that your future opponents will see and get confused and upset by.</p></div>

This is the most direct way for your rooks to influence the game. As mentioned above, you don't necessarily need to be destroying or capturing anything in order for your pieces to be making your opponents' life awkward, so principles like "rooks on open files" will almost always be good things to at least look out for.</p></div>

At the very very highest levels winning with black is really quite an impressive achievement, and black will often go into a game playing for a draw. The advantage of the first move is very pronounced, and sets the tone for the entire game, with white generally calling the shots. Attempts by black to generate active counterplay are often very risky. At lower levels, black can afford to be a bit more ambitious without worrying too much about opening up tiny weaknesses that get ruthlessly exploited.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>The more you actively engage with your opponent's pieces and position early on, the less (generally speaking) time you are spending on getting your pieces out and putting them exactly where you want them. This potentially creates weaknesses of your own. So the sharper and more confrontational the variations you want to play, the more opening theory you need to know to make sure you don't do anything that is already known to be a mistake. I don't like opening theory (because I'm a lazy player), so I tend to err on the side of just trying to do my own thing whilst making small prods at my opponent here and there. This is definitely a deficiency in my game though, and means that I'm rarely asking particularly difficult questions of my opponents in the opening.</p></div>

So you might be developing your pieces and attacking their pawns, or seizing the centre and cramping them for space, or tying their pieces down to defending each other. None of these efforts are likely to immediately cause checkmate, but they are still "attacking" in the sense that they force defensive responses from your opponent. It's rare that you will sound the charge with a specific move, but more often you'll gradually build up the pressure, without giving your opponent a chance to respond.</p></div>

They are very focused on my own structure and normally all take place within my half of the board. So when I'm playing there's normally a move where the pressure goes 'on'. That's normally when I force a direct defensive response from my opponent (i.e. do something or your piece will die!).

In the sharp but almost definitely technically unsound Muzio Gambit, white sacrifices a knight on move 5 and is attacking until they either win or run out of pieces from then on. Whereas in a Stonewall Dutch, black is almost definitely just going to play most of f5/e6/Nf6/d5/Bd6/0-0/c6/Nbd7/Ne4/Ndf6/Bd7/Be8/Bh5 and then look up and see what white has been up to.</p></div>

At higher levels of play, getting a knight to a good square or forcing someone to trade off a "good" bishop can be non-trivial wins, so moving your knight to a square where it might next turn be able to hop into a hole in the centre can constitute a "question", or moving a pawn so that next go you might be able to kick their bishop and force it to trade with your bishop. When there are more possible small wins, there are more possible ways to threaten these small wins. When you're just starting out, as long as your opponent isn't directly threatening to take one of your pieces for free or checkmate you, you probably don't have to worry too much about them gaining a microscopic positional advantage.</p></div>
