						<div class="answer-text max-732">
							<p>Everyone has an opening repertoire. Many people just have one answer for each question they might reasonably expect their opponents to ask, which means they get very good at playing those answers, but equally become very predictable. There are some openings that are razor sharp and precise, and require knowing many 15-20 move variations in order to not get destroyed without the game even starting. I personally prefer openings that are more conceptual, which tend to be slightly more flexible, require much less knowledge, but arguably lead to somewhat more boring positions because of this.</p>

							<p>So when the middlegame comes around, it's probably the kind of position I've played many times before. My strategy is usually to throw lots of pieces at their king and hope they die or I can win some material. Since I'm hoping to win at this point, I probably don't start thinking explicitly about the endgame until little suggestions of things that might become relevant start cropping up. So if pawns become isolated or doubled, or we end up with opposite colored bishops, or with a bishop on the same color square as most of our pawns, etc. If I can take one of these small positional advantages then I will, and then effectively "bank" it until the endgame actually comes around. Having one or more of these might make me more likely to head towards an endgame too.</p>


							<p>ndgames are really hard and require a lot of technique that I don't really have. Fortunately most other people don't either, because you just don't get to play that many of them.</p>

							<p>It probably is fair to say that I'm pretty aware of the opening/middlegame/endgame distinction. The opening is where I'm playing pretty much from memory, the middlegame is where I try and win, and the endgame is what I might head towards if I think I have a tangible advantage but try and avoid otherwise.</p>

							<p>So when you say that the endgame is what you might head towards - is the endgame not just the 'end of the game'? In which case won't most games have one? I know in the extremely amateur world of chess that I play in that most games come to a end where one side is actively checkmated. Is the endgame more unusual the higher up you go because a party will often resign when one side is in a dominant position?</p>

							<p>I guess this is a question for statistics to answer properly, but my gut says that there possibly are fewer endgames in higher level play. If you lose a bishop or a knight without any obvious compensation, you will almost definitely resign on the spot. That said, it's probably also true that fewer boneheaded mistakes mean that neither side may have had much of a chance to win before the endgame. Overall I'm not sure!</p>

							<p>But when I say "might head towards the endgame", I mean that I might deliberately choose to swap off pieces and accelerate progress towards the end of the game. If I'm a pawn up then trading off pieces is likely a huge win for me, because whilst a queen + 2 rooks + 1 bishop + 2 knights + 7 pawns v the same but 6 pawns is not a huge advantage, a bishop + 5 pawns v a bishop + 4 pawns probably is. Small material advantages are a much bigger deal in the endgame and leave less room for your opponent to generate compensation, so if you are slightly ahead then deliberately swapping off pieces is very important. Games can naturally meander towards an endgame where neither side is too psyched about their chances, or they can be forced.</p>

							<p>Honestly I like openings that allow you to put your pieces on nice squares without thinking too hard, and then throw them all at your opponent's king. This is not a very sophisticated strategy, but it can be very hard to deal with if you aren't prepared (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/chess/malcolmpein/3671769/Cambridge-edge-ahead.html" target="_blank">this</a> is a good example). If you can get off the beaten track without doing anything too insane then you become much more familiar with the kinds of positions that result than your opponents, and develop a big box of patterns that have worked in the past.</p>

							<p>This becomes somewhat less effective the higher level and more famous you get, as you start to become notorious for particular openings, and opponents can start preparing counters to them. This is where a degree of flexibility and unpredictability becomes invaluable, so that your opponents can't just put all their time into preparing for your Stonewall Dutch or Trompowsky, and also have to keep in mind that you might throw in a Benko Gambit or English Opening. It can be worthwhile playing these alternatives in high profile tournaments that will get their games into databases that your future opponents will see and get confused and upset by.</p>

							<p>1) Knights on the edge of the board don't attack many squares, knights in the centre of the board do. Because of their uniquely short range, they are the one piece that really benefits from being in the centre. A rook or bishop in the corner can still rake across the entire board, but a knight in the same spot looks pretty dumb.</p>

							<p>2) If you want to attack the king (I do), you need to have your pieces attacking him and the squares around him! Even if you aren't planning on immediately checkmating anytime soon, you may be able to use threats against him to force smaller concessions or weaknesses.</p>

							<p>3) An open file is one that isn't blocked by any of your pawns or pieces, and so if you put a rook at one end of it you'll be probing into some part of their position (hopefully a weak part!). This is the most direct way for your rooks to influence the game. As mentioned above, you don't necessarily need to be destroying or capturing anything in order for your pieces to be making your opponents' life awkward, so principles like "rooks on open files" will almost always be good things to at least look out for.

							<p>Coolio. Would you say your setting yourself up in the strongest position possible to deal with the largest number of variations down your opponents end (defensive) or setting yourself up to maximise your attacking options? Or a balance of the two?</p>

							<p>When I'm playing with friends sometimes it feels like there is an unspoken agreement to let the other player 'set up' so to speak. To get their pieces into the strongest structural position before the WAR takes place. When you're playing is this something that happens?

							<p>The more experienced the players, the bigger the difference between playing white and black. At the very very highest levels winning with black is really quite an impressive achievement, and black will often go into a game playing for a draw. The advantage of the first move is very pronounced, and sets the tone for the entire game, with white generally calling the shots. Attempts by black to generate active counterplay are often very risky. At lower levels, black can afford to be a bit more ambitious without worrying too much about opening up tiny weaknesses that get ruthlessly exploited.</p>

							<p>The more you actively engage with your opponent's pieces and position early on, the less (generally speaking) time you are spending on getting your pieces out and putting them exactly where you want them. This potentially creates weaknesses of your own. So the sharper and more confrontational the variations you want to play, the more opening theory you need to know to make sure you don't do anything that is already known to be a mistake. I don't like opening theory (because I'm a lazy player), so I tend to err on the side of just trying to do my own thing whilst making small prods at my opponent here and there. This is definitely a deficiency in my game though, and means that I'm rarely asking particularly difficult questions of my opponents in the opening.</p>

							<p>So the aim when black is to survive and make sure you're doing enough sensible things to not get exploited because of the disadvantage of moving second.</p>

							<p>And the aim when white is to go out there and win. When you are white, what are you looking for to begin the post opening attack? And would you ever begin your attack during the opening phase if you noticed a mistake in your opponent's opening play?</p>
