Around 1987/1988 everyone was buying Commodore Amiga and Atari ST computers. They were way more powerful than the old 8-bit computers that we had grown up with, but they required 3.5 inch floppy disks as opposed to cassettes.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>We used to all buy loads of games for these machines, and swap them with each other at school. After a while people realised that they could buy blank floppy disks and use a tool called XCopy to copy the game onto a blank disk before giving it back. Back then blank floppy disks were a valuable currency at school. One day I went to a computer fair in London with my dad and brother and found vendors that were selling big boxes of blank floppy disks *way* cheaper than what we had been paying at our local computer shop. My brother and I borrowed some money off my dad and bought a couple of boxes (I think maybe it was 50 disks per box). I took one box to school and my brother took the other. We sold both boxes in something like 2 days.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>After restocking a few weeks later I had a network of kids in other years who would act as resellers for me. It was a good laugh at that point. I'd sell other kids a box at a reduced profit and they would sell them through to their peer group. </p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>I seem to remember we were making 100% margin or near that figure; They were &#163;1 per disk at school. We started getting good relationships with the disk suppliers at these fairs and began ordering them directly. I can't think how many disks we sold; more than a thousand over the period that we were selling them. Before long however the disks became commoditised. There were other kids that started doing what we were doing so we had to start competing with them, and then the local shops started selling them more cheaply, but we had a good run!</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>It's funny writing all that and thinking about it now as it taught me a lot of important lessons. All the basics are there; seeing the opportunity, borrowing money for cashflow, arbitraging the price of the product between two markets and then over time seeing the price gap close along with the opportunity, employing a sales force.  Although I didn't know it at the time, it was a pretty good microcosm to learn from.</p></div>

It seemed obvious at that point how powerful the idea of the web and the Internet would be.

When I started Solid State Group as a web agency, "startups" weren't a thing. This was 2002, so there was no Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Basecamp, Xero or pretty much any sort of SaaS product. The dot com bubble had burst and the internet industry as a whole was pretty much destroyed. So many agencies had gone to the wall, and most of the big startups had flamed out dramatically. It was sort of a crazy time to be starting a web development agency.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>In 2002 I got made redundant a second time within a year. I thought about getting another job as a software engineer somewhere but then decided against it; starting my own company would be just as secure an option! So I sat in my bedroom for about 5 months straight and wrote a Content Management System that turned out (at the time) to be pretty good. I had a business partner who would now be described as a Product Manager and between us we carved out this business.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>I had just bought a flat when I got laid off the second time, so making money was a crystal clear target. That sharpens the mind a lot. Everything we did was oriented around getting clients and sending them invoices; preferably large invoices. The notion of raising money for a new venture at that time was absurd; there was just no way anyone was going to give money to us. It would have been a complete waste of time even trying, so we had to bootstrap. I had 3 months of runway from my severance package and that was it.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>Fast forward to London in 2015 and it's pretty crazy just how much as changed; not only the industry but also the operating environment for new companies. I get that some companies need to be heavily capitalised to grow rapidly, but some of the bullshit you see is pretty breathtaking. When you see people having parties to celebrate closing their A round! Celebrating! They should be devastated!</p></div>

All the successful ventures I have gone into were profitable within the first year; all of them. You don't have to know anything technical; you just need to orient your business around making fucking money. That's it.</p></div>

We did that classic thing of building a product and then expecting people to turn up at our day with a chequebook, but that didn't happen.

Google in 2002 was a very different beast, and both organic search and paid search were not the food fight they are today. It was either paid or organic search. The lead was a really good one though - 4 content managed websites for Essex council. We had a couple of weeks to prepare for the pitch.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>One of the best pieces of advice I was given was about how you can use your small size in comparison to your competitors to your own advantage. Even though this was a relatively small contract for most people, it would have been a massive deal for us to win it. We decided to take one of the client's current websites and basically implement the entire thing on our CMS, to demonstrate who easy it would be for them to manage the site themselves. This was a pretty big undertaking, and there's no way we would do something like this now, but as I said, you use your small size in any way you can.</p></div>

When it got to the pitch we just totally nailed it; the client was blown away that we had taken the trouble of doing all this work to show our system, and we got the news that we had won the contract on the way home! That was a massive deal and one of the best memories I have of running my own business.</p></div>

I used to think that the best moments would be when you are sat in your ivory tower, sending out massive invoices and talking to your big team, but that's bollocks. It's all about sitting in your pyjamas at 3AM hacking on some code because you can't sleep through excitement.</p></div>

That was a really big deal for us; it was the first really mass-market site we had worked on and got us really good exposure. It also meant a metric shit-load of traffic for about 3 days straight, which had me really really nervous. It was a great client (thanks John, Dan and Francis!) and a great challenge that we totally nailed. We got tickets to the show and after party. We went and got stuck into the free booze but I was still completely terrified that the site would melt under the load of millions of concurrent users, but thankfully it did the job.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>Anyway, after that I think it did become easier to get work, yes. There's a good triangulation of better case studies, more people that you are working with who can then recommend your work and then the perfect situation of when a client changes job and takes you with them. It all does start to build. Obviously your work has to be over a certain threshold of "good" but really most people just want a safe pair of hands that isn't going to wobble at the wrong moment.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>It's one of those things that you can only indirectly affect. If you try too hard at winning new business you wont get anywhere, but if you put your irons in the fire and just keep things humming eventually it comes to you. I think the mistake a lot of people make is to try and do all this direct, immediate stuff, and it's just really really hard to win work that way. You have to play the long game, and start playing it as early as possible.</p></div>

The 2 years between 2009 and 2011 were absolutely fucking horrible and an experience I never wish to repeat. I'm still absolutely furious that no one has been held to account with regards to what happened in the financial markets, and have spent the last 4 years making sure that I am insulated from all that bullshit as much as possible. It's hard to know what would have happened to the business if the meltdown had not occurred. We basically trod water for 3 years and only recently started growing again.</p></div>

Way back in 2004 we were looking for an office for our 4 person company. We realised we were growing and so we found a nice premises in Shoreditch that could fit about 14 people in to. Our first office was just Matt and myself, and we shared with another company. So we just did exactly the same thing. This was before gumtree or Twitter (!) so we went and stuck a notice up in Franco's, which at the time was THE place to get a lunch in Shoreditch.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>We got the space filled pretty easily, and it actually helped cover a lot of our rent. One of the first companies that moved in was 3 guys called Square Circle; a design and UX agency. We got on with them really well, and before long were pitching on a huge project, that we landed. That turned out to be well into six figures worth of work, and at that moment we realised the value of co-working, especially in Shoreditch which has an insane density of companies all doing similar things.</p></div>

From there we opened 2 other premises and now have over 150 desks being rented out. It's great seeing small companies working together, and we have really active mailing list where people ask for help, advice or even offer pitches to people.</p></div>

It's almost as if doing what I'm doing is maybe perceived as less worthy. The extreme of that obviously is Rocket Internet in Germany who "clone" US businesses. People look down their noses at that business, and the Samwer brothers, but the point is that execution is *hard* and ideas are relatively cheap.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>After doing this for quite a while I do think I'm more analytical in my approach now.

                                                                            <div><p>I guess I am more analytical now, but I am mainly doing this to decide what not to work on, as opposed to what to work on. For example the other day an opportunity came up which initially sounded really great, but after looking at the number of people searching Google for the particular relevant term, we decided not to go ahead with any sort of further work on it, because the scale was not there. I'm not talking about the billion dollar businesses that big VCs are after, but just something that would get a relatively good ROI.</p></div>

Obviously there's luck, timing etc, but on the whole I think this graph is representative of real life. So we aren't really aiming at billion dollar businesses. There's a lot of low hanging fruit that is not going to return that sort of money but is still going to give good returns, and of course you are still in control of your own destiny and not working for the man.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>With one of the companies I work with we joke about different levels of money. You go up in scale. Car money, house money, yacht money, island money. If you are always working on startups that are aiming at yacht or island money, you're going to have a hard time! We aim more at house money businesses. I think soon we will have enough recurring revenue coming in that we can try riskier projects that have a higher return, but I think generally it's a good idea to start at car money and work your way up.</p></div>

Everything from the UX to the App store side of things to the support is just mega impressive. Especially considering that eCommerce can be really really complex. They have really helped the GetVape guys launch and iterate their offering quickly, which has been invaluable. </p></div>

What's interesting to me about Slack is how they demonstrated the power of UX. There were plenty of group chat apps around before Slack (Campfire, Hipchat, IRC, Lync and a load of enterprise ones) so ostensibly you would think that Slack would not be able to grow orders of magnitude more quickly than those other products but they have. I think the reason that they have is because they are just completely nailing the UX side of things. There are so many tiny little details in Slack, and I keep finding them, months and months after using the product heavily, day after day. I find that really impressive.</p></div>

Funnily enough we used to share an office building with them on Leonard Street back in the day where rents in Shoreditch were still in their teens. Back then they were just this utter cliche. It just looked like Nathan Barley. They were mainly a high end fashion print magazine back then. If you look at the quality of writing, reporting and video coming out of their London office now I am always taken aback. Plus they know how to take the piss out of themselves now.

Fund a fusion reactor and thorium fission reactor I think. The story of how nuclear power was basically hijacked by national “defence” agencies is pretty terrible. If we hadn't been so busy worrying about generating weapons grade plutonium from nuclear reactors in the 50s and 60s the world would be a way more enjoyable place to be. “Solving” energy would have a bazillion benefits so wide reaching I can't even imagine what things would be like if it was achieved.

The one huge positive that I see what with that model is that there is no “lead investor” that is going to be busting your balls all day long. Sure, you have a responsibility to the investors, and you need to provide regular investor updates etc etc, but by their nature this whole lead investor aspect just disappears. </p></div>

I guess it can act as a double edged sword, as you don't have investors to go to for advice, but I guess it depends on what is important to you when you are raising money.</p></div>

Someone might invest only £500 to a company, but they then get the chance to “see inside” that business. To a lot of people, me for example, the information that comes from those investor reports is potentially very valuable. How are Facebook display ads performing? What are they paying per app-install? What about video retargeting? All these soft aspects of the business (especially marketing) are then available to see. </p></div>

One thing I have discovered, however, is that the demographic has an enormous influence on which marketing channels you should focus on. For example, one of our investments is www.getvape.co.uk  . They have found huge traction through Facebook, whereas Twitter has been pretty much worthless for them. Whatever it is, vapers are just not that into Twitter. On the flip side, we are building a fantasy football platform ourselves - www.dugoutfc.com - and for football fans, Twitter is MASSIVE. There are dozens of fan accounts that have over 100k followers. </p></div>

That seems to be the best way of finding where you are going to get best ROI and then seeing how big that channel can be. </p></div>
