It's easy to think of a circle as something flat, as if competence is measured by the width of your scope. But I think a sphere would be more appropriate -- I am most concerned with the depth of understanding. A very wide circle can still be as flat as it is on a piece of paper, but if it takes you 4,000 miles to get to the center of the Earth, invariably it would have an even wider equator. </p></div>

It is backed by my temperament to patiently drill down until I hit the golden nuggets of insight and unmistakeable value that happens to be mistaken due to prevailing views of the surface. To me, investing is about discovering that the world is not flat nor round, but spherical.</p></div>

                                                                            <p>1) If you think about stocks as something you own, the perspective should be one of contentment with the asset. Say, for example, I was going to buy a picture to hang in my house (to own) - I would want it to be one I could look at every day and enjoy, do you view a stock the same way? It has to be something you're truely happy with - as opposed to an asset you don't like very much, but hope to sell on for a profit at a later date.</p>
                                                                            <p>2) In terms of a margin of safty, you want to have a figure of the true value of a business in your head - and buy stocks when it is well below this?</p>

In the short term, people's hearts and minds win out (and their irrationality leads to situations where point '2)' works and when it doesn't)</p>
                                                                            <p>4) It's down to you to do the work, in the long run the market is not wrong, you were. You have to do your research properly, turn over every stone.</p>

How does one, or did you, go about picking your sphere? And do you think of spheres as verticals (for example, the automotive industry) or as something more conceptual?</p>

It's not the same as owning it wholly though, as stock ownership is usually fractional. You only get to hang this picture in your house maybe one day out of the year. I don't feel as happy if my great business is trading at a dangerously overvalued price, it can be tempting to sell because you no longer have the same margin of safety compared to other more reasonably valued assets.</p></div>

The most recent example is where he extracted Duracell from his P&G stake in a stock for stock transaction that had tax advantages as well. Since Duracell produces steady, albeit slightly declining, FCF -- he will collect the cash value over time rather than sell it all at once and trigger tax consequences -- and still retain 100% ownership of a great brand. It is also important that this is complementary to his insurance float, which alleviates the trade off of receiving a lump sum today versus a prolonged payback period. Who knew that 15 minutes could save you quite a bit on cost of capital?</p></div>

Companies can also buyback shares today, which increases the dividends per share that you receive in the now. Therefore, the more cash that piles up to the shareholder, the more provable that the value is actually secured rather than subject to destructive spending or time inflation.</p></div>

Be careful not to confuse secondary market profits from the underlying business. A stock going up doesn't prove that you are right, it just means that the market agrees with you for a certain period of time. Cash generation is a permanent fact stemming from the reality of business competition.

How much reinvestment is necessary to maintain prices? If an ideal business requires very little reinvestment and consistently raises prices -- then how far from this ideal is the business in question? If it's anywhere close, it should jump out at you -- otherwise it's likely to be farther away from predictably durable.</p></div>

Recently he admitted that more capital needs to be reinvested, so it is more capital-intensive than many people would prefer, but it's more important that he thinks BNSF will be around in 100 years. So long as reinvestment does improve pricing power, then it is actually a great situation to have a way to automatically redeploy the massive amounts of profits within the same regional monopoly and earn a compounded return on the incremental capital. Geography can play a big role in durability because it does not change easily.        </p></div>

Most of the time, your stakeholders won't even allow you to survive this competition -- it is counter-intuitive to pay someone to do nothing even if it is the best decision. On the other hand, sometimes you have to actively do something painful -- such as massive capital expenditures or sweeping transformations like IBM did in the 90's.</p></div>

The leader of this effort has compared it to performing surgery on one's self. Berkshire Hathaway also grew out of a 23-year battle with its ailing textile business, as well as frustrating episodes with Buffalo News, Geico, National Indemnity, etc. Through this, Buffett has proven to be a rather skilled surgeon. Of course, he'd still prefer companies that have superb immune systems to begin with.</p></div>

Most of the time you can't predict the winner, but once in a while you can.

If you always use a long-term perspective then you can easily weed out companies that engage in short-term thinking. If you keep avoiding things that are too difficult to predict or are simply nonsense, then eventually you will stumble upon something suitable. You have to keep learning and revisiting things because the dynamics may have changed.</p></div>

Luckily, if your actionable ideas are long-term holdings then eventually you will find enough to be fully invested, which frees up your time to pursue more difficult research.</p></div>

Ultimately you have to fall back to the price you're willing to pay at the time the market is offering these choices to you. The right price can make a growth business be a more certainly profitable investment, and a bad price can make a safe asset become a risky investment.</p></div>

In aggregate, a series of low risk / high reward bets will do better than medium risk / very high reward bets -- even if the ratio and expected value is exactly the same. The reason is because you cannot control the order in which these outcomes occur.</p></div>

In the first case, however, the capital has not suffered any permanent losses.</p></div>

The adverse impact to your lifestyle of losing a substantial part of your net worth is likely to outweigh the benefits of a couple incremental percentage points. This is especially true if the risk-averse approach actually ends up earning even higher rates of return because the market eventually does reward these 'safe bets' quite handsomely.</p></div>
