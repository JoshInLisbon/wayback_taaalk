Let's look at some of the big Silicon Valley tech companies who have had these dismal single digit diversity percentages as it relates to their U.S.-based workforces. Some of these companies are working to correct this by increasing recruiting efforts, supporting coding bootcamps, etc. So in the next few years, we will start to see these numbers change for the better.

It would be a huge disservice to have put forth the effort to diversify your workforce only to have your workplace culture end up driving those same people away.</p></div>

In the game everything gets stripped away apart from your actions, and those that do the best in the long run rise to the top - it doesn't matter what your race is, what your sex is, if you're disabled (there are blind poker players), etc... everyone is allowed to play and, in the long run, merit always wins.</p>
                                                                            <p>I kind of view the world in this way, or rather that's how I think the world should be. But the world seems more complicated! In real life instead of betting actions and skill being all that matters in the long run there's so many other factors that take place. Normally it's someone's decision if you get a step up in your career, and (even this is true with poker) we don't all come from backgrounds with equal opportunities. Some people have great educations from a young age, loving parents, etc...</p>
                                                                            <p>When you talked about the Silicon Valley companies correcting their situation by increasing education, I think that's great! Because it means they are creating a situation where people will rise to the top based on the merit they are now having the opportunity to develop. But another part of me get's stuck with the idea. I don't know if these programs are just focused on, say, people from minority races and women - but if they are, and there's a young white kid from a very disadvantaged background, with poor parenting and a lack of educational opportunities - it doesn't feel quite right that he is not given that opportunity too.</p>
                                                                            <p>Another thing that I have a hard time with is that sometimes I feel that focusing praise around something within a channel (for example sex or race) means that people feel more incompetent than they did before. This is an advert in the UK that really bugged me recently:</p>

My gut reaction when I saw it was that by setting the frame as 'girls can do this too' you in fact increase the gap between the sexes, because it sets the underlying tone that the gap is there. I talked about it with some male and female friends and there was a mixed response. Checking out the hashtag on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thisgirlcan&src=typd" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thisgirlcan&src=typd</a>) the response seems to be largely super positive.

If they were, I don't <i>think</i> we'd really be having this conversation. But it's sure nice to think that they are, isn't it? Because thinking that absolves any sort of possible feelings of guilt based on discrimination (overt or hidden). Remember the adage "it's not what you know, but who you know"? You could be the most talented coder or designer in the game, but if you're not given a shot because of things which are outside of your control (race, gender, sexual orientation, ableness, etc.), where does that leave you? Skill helps, yes, but it's not the only deciding factor -- career advancement or otherwise.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>I want to dissect something you mentioned about getting stuck on the idea of minority-focused advancement "pipeline" programs because white children may not have that same opportunity. Diversity is not a zero-sum game. These types of programs usually have pretty clear definitions on who their groups are serving. <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/" target="_blank">Black Girls Code</a> is for young girls of color ages 7 to 17. <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> works with high school girls. <a href="http://www.code2040.org/" target="_blank">CODE2040</a> works specifically with increasing the number of Black and Latino/as in the tech sector. These are important areas worth addressing as it relates to the longevity of the tech industry (and by proxy, the design industry). It would be shortsighted to look at those programs and wonder why they would work against their own missions. Not only that, just because these programs exist for these groups does not mean they are working in opposition to those who are not in those groups.</p></div>
                                                                            <div><p>Now let's talk about the #thisgirlcan campaign you mentioned. You said that your gut reaction was that the campaign sets the tone that there is a gap between the sexes. But does it really? It's pretty evident from numerous studies and first-hand anecdotes the societal gaps that exist between men and women across a number of different areas (career advancement, pay wages, representation in government, etc.). And there are certain issues which affect women in a way that do not affect men. I took a look at the This Girl Can page, and what jumps out to me is this opening statement: "Fear of judgment is stopping many of us from taking part in exercise. But as thousands of women up and down the country are proving, it really doesn't have to." Women already have external influences (TV, magazines, etc.) pressuring them to fit a certain aesthetic ideal of beauty. Imagine if every time you went to the gym you were ogled or catcalled when you're just trying to work out. Or someone makes snide remarks because you're all sweaty and tired after leaving the gym. Those types of micro and macroaggressions can affect someone's sense of self-worth, maybe to the point of them not wanting to work out. But this campaign works to help women feel good about themselves by knowing they are not alone out there in feeling this and there's a community of support to help them. I think that's pretty damn awesome.</p></div>

You know when you've been looking at a thing one way all your life, and someone begins to shine a light on it from a different angle and you realise what you've been thinking has been rather muddled - that is how I feel.</p>
                                                                            <p>I don't know if it's a mistake that other people make, but I feel like I've been trying too hard to build up mental models behind the concept of diversity. "Logically" breaking down what is in fact an incredibly complex human thing into over simplified blocks / arguments, trying to turn it into a simple maths puzzle so to speak. When in fact another, and perhaps simpler, way to look at the situation is positive action > no action. You're right, it is not zero sum.</p>
                                                                            <p>So right now my perspective is: irrelevant to the group that you're focusing on promoting, increasing that groups confidence and their skill level is a good thing. And doing a good thing is a good thing (which does not make anyone's life outside of that group worse [and if it does, there's probably something up with them - I think the biggest cause of racism, sexism is some underling and unfounded fear in an individual]). Is that how you view the situation?</p>
